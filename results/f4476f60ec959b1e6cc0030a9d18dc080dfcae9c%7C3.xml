The majority of the US land area of 2.3 billion acres is rural, and almost 1.4 billion acres are nonfederal rural land, including cropland (361 million acres), rangeland (409 million), pasture (120 million), and forest (409 million).[2] More than 60 percent of US land (99 percent of cropland) is privately owned[3] and can be transferred with few restrictions. Ownership of rural land is therefore attractive for investors, as well as for agricultural producers.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;National concerns about foreign ownership of agricultural land have resulted in federal law that requires foreign owners to disclosure their ownership of agricultural land to the US Department of Agriculture.[4] States have addressed concerns about farmland ownership by exercising authority under their general &amp;lsquo;police power&amp;rsquo; to regulate land within their borders. Some states have restricted the ownership of farmland by aliens, residents of other states, or business entities, particularly corporations. Some of these state laws have faced constitutional challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Federal Law&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;h4&gt;1.1. Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, both federal and state governments in the United States feared the significant loss of agricultural land to non-agricultural uses. The National Agricultural Lands Study evaluated state and local programs to protect farmland and made recommendations for avoiding loss of farmland to other uses.[5] The nation experienced a renewed interest in state and local government programs to protect agricultural land; these included agricultural districts, conservation easements, rural zoning and land-use controls, right to farm laws, and special valuation of farmland for property tax purposes.[6]&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The focus on protection of agricultural land was accompanied by concern about the extent and the effects of foreign ownership of farmland. No national system collected information about alien ownership of agricultural land in the United States. Moreover, most states had no records of the status -- citizen or alien -- of landowners, and only two states then required alien owners of farmland to report their holdings.[7]&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;This lack of information about foreign ownership of farmland, accompanied by uncertainty about its effects on land prices and other issues, led to the passage of the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978.[8] The law (AFIDA) was intended in part to &amp;lsquo;determine the effects of foreign persons acquiring, transferring, and holding agricultural land, particularly the effects &amp;hellip; on family farms and rural communities.&amp;rsquo;[9]&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;AFIDA does not restrict foreign investment in agricultural land. Instead, it requires foreign investors to report their holdings. The law requires any &amp;lsquo;foreign person who acquires or transfers any interest ... in agricultural land&amp;rsquo; to report that transaction to the US Secretary of Agriculture within 90 days. The report, on a prescribed USDA form, must provide information about the foreign person, the land (including a legal description and acreage), its proposed use, and the purchase price.[10] State Departments of Agriculture receive copies of reports involving land in their states.[11]&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;AFIDA definitions ensure comprehensive reporting. &amp;lsquo;Agricultural land&amp;rsquo; includes any land &amp;lsquo;used for agricultural, forestry, or timber production.&amp;rsquo;[12] AFIDA defines &amp;lsquo;person&amp;rsquo; broadly to include both individuals and legal entities (e.g., corporations, associations, and other legal entities). &amp;lsquo;Foreign person&amp;rsquo; includes any individual who is not a citizen or permanent resident of the United States and any foreign government. It also includes a legal entity created under the laws of a foreign government or with its principal place of business outside the United States. In addition, it includes an entity created under the laws of a US state, but in which a &amp;lsquo;significant interest&amp;rsquo; (defined by regulation) is held by foreign persons (individuals, entities, or governments).[13]&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h4&gt;1.2. Foreign Holdings of US Agricultural Land&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Reports required under the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act provide data about foreign ownership, and the USDA publishes annual reports of foreign holdings. The majority of US land in foreign ownership is agricultural land, including forests. The most recent USDA report, with data for 2013, indicates that about 2 percent of privately-owned agricultural land in the United States (1 percent of all US land) is in foreign ownership. Foreign holdings of all US land totaled almost 26.82 million acres in 2013. Most of these holdings, almost 26.2 million acres, were agricultural land. Between 2012 and 2013, foreign holdings increased by only 31,604 acres.[14]&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The USDA reported that 2013 foreign holdings include the following: timber or forest, 51 percent; cropland, 20 percent; pasture and other agricultural land, 26 percent. Only 2 percent of foreign holdings are non-agricultural land. Foreign holdings exist in all 50 states. Maine, in the Northeast, has the largest number of acres, mostly forest or timber. Texas and Alabama follow with the second and third highest number of agricultural acres in foreign holdings. In general, however, most foreign holdings are in the South and the West of the United States.[15]&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Investors from various countries own agricultural land in the United States. Canadians hold 25 percent; other important investors represent the Netherlands (18 percent), Germany (7 percent), the United Kingdom (6 percent), and Portugal (5 percent). Investors from all other countries hold 38 percent of foreign-held land.[16]&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3&gt;2. State Law Measures&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally states have controlled land ownership and land use within their borders. Using their police power, some states have enacted laws (or, less frequently, constitutional provisions) that govern ownership of real property by aliens or by business entities. Some states have enacted provisions intended to protect their agricultural land from foreign or corporate ownership. The following discussion focuses on these provisions and provides a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h4&gt;2.1. Foreign Ownership&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1970s, state laws did not significantly restrict foreign ownership of land.[17] A government report published in 1978 indicated that although 25 states regulated some aspects of alien ownership of farmland, few states imposed significant restrictions.[18] Only 9 states prohibited alien ownership or imposed major restrictions; 11 states restricted the amount or duration of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Now, decades later, many states place no restrictions on alien ownership of real property.[19] A number of states, however, distinguish between resident and nonresident aliens. In these states, resident aliens are free to own land, but nonresident aliens are subject to prohibitions or restrictions on ownership or only to obligations to report their ownership. Some states regulate ownership by foreign (including out-of-state) corporations.[20]&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the importance of agriculture, Midwest farm states are mostly likely to regulate ownership of agricultural land by nonresident aliens. Indeed, many of the states with corporate farming laws (discussed below) also restrict alien ownership of farmland.[21] These restrictions vary among the states, but may prohibit ownership by nonresident aliens, impose acreage limitations, or set time limits on ownership.[22]&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Iowa, for example, allows alien ownership of most real property.[23] But, with a few exceptions, Iowa does not permit individual nonresident aliens or business entities with majority ownership by nonresident aliens to purchase or acquire agricultural land.[24] In the few instances when aliens own agricultural land, Iowa requires annual reports of the land ownership and its present and anticipated use.[25] Iowa also requires reports from business entities that own agricultural land.[26]&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;In Illinois, an 1887 statute limited the duration of alien ownership of real property. After repeal of that statute in 1992, aliens may acquire, hold, and dispose of real property without special restrictions.[27] The Illinois Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act, enacted in 1979, requires any &amp;lsquo;foreign person&amp;rsquo; (defined broadly to include legal entities) or foreign government to report their ownership of agricultural land to the state Director of Agriculture.[28]&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h4&gt;2.2. Corporate Ownership and Operation&lt;/h4&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Federal statistics indicate that in 2012, only about 13 percent of farms in the United States were operated as corporations, partnerships, or other legal entities; only about 5.1 percent of farms were corporations.[29] Of these, 4.5 percent were family owned, most with 10 or fewer shareholders; only 0.5 percent were not family owned. Corporate farms averaged 1,230 acres, but many are larger.[30]&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2013, nine states had enacted restrictions on corporate farming, either as statutes or as amendments to state constitutions.[31] These laws &amp;lsquo;restrict corporations [and other limited-liability entities] from owing agricultural land and, often, engaging in production agriculture, unless the corporation is closely held (usually by family members) and active farmers or rural residents are included as owners.&amp;rsquo;[32] In the aggregate, they limit corporate farming on 312 million acres, about one-third of US farmland.[33] Although numerous arguments (e.g., concerns about limited liability or large-scale land ownership) support their existence, many view these laws simply as attempts to &amp;lsquo;protect the family farm.&amp;rsquo;[34]&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Although state laws vary, they generally prohibit corporations from specific activities -- that is, from owning farmland and sometimes also from farming. The laws provide exceptions for some agricultural activities (e.g., poultry or swine production or operation of livestock facilities). In addition, some corporations -- family farm corporations with restricted size and ownership structure -- are permitted to own and to operate agricultural land. In some states, a family member must live on the farm or be engaged in farming.[35] Because most agricultural corporations are small family-owned entities, the family-farm exemption is significant.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Restrictions on corporate ownership are vulnerable to constitutional challenge. The Commerce Clause of the US Constitution authorizes Congress &amp;lsquo;to regulate commerce &amp;hellip; among the several states.&amp;rsquo;[36] Even when Congress has not regulated, the so-called Dormant Commerce Clause prohibits states from enacting laws that discriminate against, or unduly burden, interstate commerce. Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine is complex, and the result of a challenge depends on the language and intent of the state law, the nature of the state interest, and the degree of burden (including economic) on interstate commerce. Although a few exceptions apply, a state law that discriminates against interstate commerce is likely to be invalid under the Dormant Commerce Clause. If a state law does not discriminate and serves a legitimate public interest, &amp;lsquo;the extent of the burden [on commerce] that will be tolerated will &amp;hellip; depend on the nature of the local interest involved and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.&amp;rsquo;[37]&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Federal appellate court judgments held that corporate farming measures in Nebraska and South Dakota violate the Dormant Commerce Clause.[38] The Nebraska restriction on corporate farming was embedded in the state Constitution. The exception for family farm corporations required a family member to be &amp;lsquo;residing on or actively engaged in the day to day labor and management of the farm.&amp;rsquo;[39] The US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit interpreted this exception, coupled with the definition of &amp;lsquo;the farm,&amp;rsquo; to require the family member to be physically present in Nebraska. The court therefore held that the statute discriminated against residents of other states and violated the Dormant Commerce Clause.[40] Similarly, South Dakota had a constitutional restriction on corporate farming, Amendment E, approved by voters in 1998.[41] In a Dormant Commerce Clause challenge, the Eighth Circuit found that Amendment E, neutral on its face, had been enacted with discriminatory intent, evidenced by language in documents supporting the amendment, statements made by those drafting the amendment, and even in statements at trial.[42] The state had no legitimate state interest in adopting Amendment E, nor could it show that its purpose could not be achieved in a nondiscriminatory way. Therefore the court held that Amendment E violated the Dormant Commerce Clause.[43]&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The United States offers abundant rural land and natural resources, valued for production of food, fiber, and timber, as well as for natural beauty, habitat, and other amenities. Because the majority of US rural land is privately owned, and few restrictions limit the ability of private owners to sell their property, agricultural land is attractive to investors, both domestic and foreign.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Despite widespread fear of foreign ownership in the 1970s, information collected under the federal disclosure requirements in the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act indicates that only a small percentage (about 2 percent) of agricultural land is owned by foreign investors. Disclosure has helped to alleviate concerns about the availability of US farmland to provide food and fiber in the future. Although federal laws do not limit foreign ownership, a few states restrict ownership by foreign owners. Most state restrictions on alien land ownership are minimal. A few important agricultural states impose restrictions on ownership by out-of-state corporations, but these provisions are vulnerable to constitutional challenge. More stringent regulation of foreign ownership of agricultural land seems unlikely, at least as long as US production of food and fiber remains secure.&lt;/p&gt;</content><legacyfootnotes/><footnotes><footnote>1 Professor Emerita and Bock Chair Emerita in Agricultural Law, University of Illinois, USA; Fellow, Wageningen School of Social Sciences, Law and Governance Group, Wageningen, Netherlands.
