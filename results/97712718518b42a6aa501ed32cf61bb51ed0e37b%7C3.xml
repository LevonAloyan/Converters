New food products of biotechnology must be assessed to ensure that they present no dangers to health or the environment. Livestock production practices remain controversial in light of animal welfare concerns and potential health effects of meat and other livestock products. Application of insecticides and herbicides raises concerns about human health and the environment. Consumers have demanded regulatory action to ensure the safety of other food ingredients. In the United States, as in Europe, new statues and regulations help to ensure continued food safety, in light of scientific, technological, and social developments.&lt;/p&gt;</inleiding><content>&lt;h3&gt;1. New Technologies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific discoveries continue to affect food production in the United States. Federal agencies approved two new types of genetically engineered (GE) food products: GE salmon and Arctic apples. Congress required labels for GE food, preempting several state labeling laws. In light of new technologies, regulatory agencies have begun the process of modernizing the US regulatory system for GE crops and other products. Recent enforcement of trade secret laws helped to protect business owners when unauthorized use of seeds and trade secrets deprived those owners of revenues from legally-recognized property rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1.1. GE Fish&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, after a 20-year regulatory process, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the AquAdvantage&lt;span class="superscript"&gt;®&lt;/span&gt; salmon, the first GE animal approved for commercial sale as food.[2] The GE salmon, with a growth hormone gene from the Chinook salmon and a promoter from the Arctic ocean eelpout, requires 25 percent less feed and reaches market weight much faster than other Atlantic salmon.[3] AquaBounty Technologies developed AquAdvantage and planned to produce eggs in Canada and grow out the salmon in Panama.[4]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA governs GE animals under the new animal drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA)[5] and FDA regulations.[6] New animal drugs, which are considered adulterated until they are approved, are drugs (‘articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.’) intended for use in animals other than humans.[7] In a guidance document, the FDA indicated that an ‘rDNA construct in a GE animal that is intended to affect the structure or function of the animal, regardless of the intended use of products that may be produced by the GE animal, meets the [FDCA] drug definition.’[8] Therefore, sponsors must apply for approval with a new animal drug application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA requires sponsors of new animal drugs to submit data to demonstrate safety for human health and the environment and effectiveness. AquaBounty Technologies provided data and information in support of its new animal drug application. The FDA reviewed the data, determining that the genes inserted in the GE salmon remained stable over several generations, the salmon is safe for humans and animals to eat, the genetic engineering is safe for the fish, and the salmon meets the sponsor’s claim about faster growth.[9]&lt;span class="superscript"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;In addition, the FDA conducted an environmental assessment, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act,[10] and issued a finding of no significant impact.[11]&lt;span class="superscript"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The FDA approved AquAdvantage salmon, but required appropriate physical and biological containment measures to ensure the identity, quality, and purity of the animal lineage as well as to limit potential impacts on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA did not require grown-out AquAdvantage salmon to be labeled because the salmon has no meaningful differences in composition and is as safe to eat as other Atlantic salmon. Congress, however, prohibited the introduction or delivery of GE salmon in interstate commerce until the FDA published labeling guidelines.[12] The FDA then banned import of GE salmon temporarily via an import alert addressed to FDA employees.[13] The National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard, discussed below, will require labels for GE salmon and other GE foods. No GE salmon is currently sold for food in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1.2. GE Arctic Apples&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Okanagan Specialty Fruits petitioned the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) agency that governs GE crops, for nonregulated status of its Arctic™ apple.[14] A gene inserted into Arctic apples makes them resistant to browning when fruits are bruised or sliced, so cut fruits require fewer antibrowning agents. Arctic apples were field tested in New York and Washington under permits granted by APHIS. As required by the Plant Protection Act, APHIS evaluated data submitted by Okanagan to determine whether the new apple varieties might pose a plant pest risk to agricultural crops or other plants. APHIS published its analysis for public comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, APHIS approved the petition for nonregulated status of Golden Delicious and Granny Smith apples[15] and in 2016 APHIS extended approval to Fuji apples.[16] All three apples are considered non-browning Arctic apples. After approval, Okanagan Specialty Fruits can sell budwood and budwood grafted to rootstock (existing apple trees) with the GE trait to growers.[17] Sales of sliced Arctic apples are expected to begin in 2017.[18]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1.3. Federal Labeling of Bioengineered Foods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 1992 Statement of Policy, the FDA stated that foods produced from GE crops did not require special labels because GE foods did not differ materially from other foods.[19] Eventually some consumers and non-governmental organizations demanded labels for GE foods. In the absence of federal requirements, state legislatures considered labeling laws, and a few states enacted laws that required labels for GE foods. Vermont’s law, the most prominent, was scheduled to take effect in July 2016.[20] In part to preempt Vermont’s law, Congress enacted the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard (GE Disclosure law).[21] The federal law requires labels for GE food and preempts state and local GE labeling laws.[22]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the statute, ‘bioengineering’ refers to a food&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(A) that contains genetic material that has been modified through in vitro recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) techniques; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(B) for which the modification could not otherwise be obtained through conventional breeding or found in nature.[23]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law applies to food subject to labeling under the FDCA and to some food subject to labeling under laws implement by the USDA. The narrow definition of bioengineering in the law may exclude some processed foods and may not apply to foods created by new technologies (for example, gene deletion) rather than rDNA techniques.[24]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new law, bioengineered food and food with bioengineered ingredients must comply with USDA labeling regulations.[25] The USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service will implement and enforce the law, and regulations must be enacted by July 2018. The USDA must determine the threshold for labeling (the amount of bioengineered ingredients that trigger disclosure), as well as the type of labeling required. The GE Disclosure Law authorizes disclosure by ‘text, symbol, or electronic or digital link,’ and the food operator will be able to select the type of disclosure.[26]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the GE Disclosure law, the USDA may not consider food from animals bioengineered only because the animals consumed GE feed.[27] Some marketers, however, may want to inform consumers that their meat products came from animals that did not consume GE feed. In 2016, the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the USDA published a compliance guideline to enable meat, poultry and egg producers to make ‘negative claims’ to inform consumers that the product contains no bioengineered ingredients or was derived from animals that consumed no GE feed.[28] The guideline provides instructions and sample labels for these claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1.4. Modernizing the US Regulatory System for GE Crops&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of important new genetic technologies, the US plans to update its regulatory system for biotechnology. In 2011, the Office of Science and Technology Policy set out principles for regulating these emerging technologies. Regulation should protect health and the environment without inhibiting innovation or creating barriers to trade.[29]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The September 2016 National Strategy for Modernizing the Regulatory System for Biotechnology Products applies this policy to biotechnology.[30] Its goal is ‘to ensure that the Federal regulatory system is equipped to efficiently assess the risks, if any, associated with future products of biotechnology while supporting innovation, protecting health and the environment, promoting public confidence in the regulatory process, increasing transparency and predictability, and reducing unnecessary costs and burdens.’[31] The National Strategy indicates that major regulatory agencies (FDA, USDA, and Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]) plan to improve communication, to collaborate in scientific oversight, and to review their policies for regulating products of biotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Update to the Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology, finalized in January 2017, sets out the current responsibilities of the USDA, FDA, and EPA for regulating products of biotechnology, along with the statutory authority for each agency and the ‘protection goal’ associated with each source of authority.[32] The Updated Coordinated Framework identifies numerous biotechnology product areas (including food from GE plants and animals) and the responsibility and coordination among regulatory agencies for oversight of organisms derived from GE plants, GE animals, GE microbes and cells.[33] Case studies provide examples of agency roles and the process of regulation.[34]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the USDA and the FDA have started to reconsider their regulatory approaches. The USDA’s APHIS proposed amendments to its 1987 regulation that governs release and commercialization of GE organisms.[35] Similarly, the FDA published a request for comments about food safety risks, safety assessments, and regulation of genome editing in new plant varieties used for foods. The FDA did not propose new regulatory measures.[36]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two recent reports from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine provide important impetus for the modernization of the US regulatory system. A 2016 report recommended, among other things, that regulatory focus be on the product of biotechnology: the risk of novel characteristics to health or environment, uncertainty about severity of harm, and potential for exposure. A new product with no traits or intended alterations that pose health or environment concerns should face no further testing. Products with potential for health or environmental effects or with differences from comparators that cannot be interpreted should be subject to further safety testing.[37] In addition, the National Academies carried out an independent study of risks (or lack of risks) and risk assessment that focused on genetic engineering and recent innovative biotechnologies (including genome engineering and targeted manipulation of genetic information).[38] This report, Preparing for Future Products of Biotechnology, viewed the National Strategy and the Updated Coordinated Framework as important starting points, but indicated that not all products of innovative biotechnologies will fit within existing agency jurisdictions.[39] Therefore regulators may need to use ‘the flexibility available under their statutes to minimize gaps in jurisdiction’ and should use the most suitable regulatory system for new products.[40]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1.5. Theft of Trade Secrets&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plant breeders have developed seed protected by patent law and the Plant Variety Protection Act.[41] Seeds raise special complications because they ‘reproduce of their own accord.’[42] Therefore ‘every customer is … a potential rival’[43] who has the ability to replicate a plant breeder’s proprietary seed. To protect their property rights, firms sell seed under a licensing agreement.[44] Under the agreement, growers agree not to plant any of the harvested seed and not to sell seed to others for planting.[45] Moreover, the purchaser cannot make new copies of the seed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While owners of proprietary seeds have been successful in enforcing their rights in the United States, enforcement in foreign countries is more difficult, even when licensing agreements apply.[46] Although most countries have agreed to the obligations of the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights, rural farmers in developing countries often save seed to replant for their next crop. In this situation, enforcement of proprietary rights becomes impractical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intentional theft of proprietary seed raises criminal-law issues. In 2013, the United States arrested a Chinese national who was part of a 5-year conspiracy to steal trade secrets from US seed companies.[47] In 2016, the defendant, a permanent resident of the United States, was sentenced to a 36-month prison term for conspiracy to steal trade secrets, and two farms used in the conspiracy were forfeited.[48] The convicted man pleaded guilty to participation in the long-term conspiracy to steal trade secrets from seed companies. He had participated in the theft of inbred corn seeds (which can be replanted) from fields in Iowa and elsewhere for the purpose of transporting the seeds to China. The stolen inbred, or parent, seeds were the valuable trade secrets of DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto.[49]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Livestock Farming&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both federal and state legislation and administrative action continue to govern livestock production and the marketing of livestock products. Congress repealed country of origin labeling for some meat products. The FDA amended its Veterinary Feed Directive rules, which require veterinary authorization for use of certain antibiotics in animal feed. The USDA will permit marketing claims that meat products came from animals that did not receive hormones or beta agonists and enacted new rules for organic animal production to address animal welfare concerns. On the state level, California adopted a law requiring more space for chickens, and marketing firms are declining to purchase eggs from caged birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.1. Country of Origin Labeling&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2002, Congress enacted legislation that required retailers to inform consumers of the country of origin of certain agricultural commodities.[50] After a lengthy regulatory process, USDA adopted mandatory country of origin labeling (COOL) regulations in 2009.[51] Various groups objected to the COOL regulations, with a major concern about possible discrimination against imported meat products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canadian livestock producers and suppliers of meat products alleged that COOL resulted in less favorable treatment for Canadian beef, pork, and livestock.[52] Canada and Mexico therefore requested establishment of a World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement panel to determine whether the COOL provisions violated international trade obligations under Articles 2.1 and 2.2 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. The WTO analysis showed that compliance with COOL would add expenses to segregate products of imported livestock in the production chain, thus creating less favorable treatment for Canadian cattle and hogs.[53] The WTO Dispute Resolution Panel and Appellate Body held that COOL violated the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WTO ruling seemed to leave open the possibility to require some information on country of origin.[54] In 2013, the USDA amended its regulations to comply with international commitments; the amended rule required information on animal origin of muscle meat at birth, production, and slaughter.[55] Canada challenged this regulation, and the WTO Dispute Resolution Appellate Body found that the new US regulation also violated WTO obligations.[56] The Appellate Body recommended that the Dispute Settlement Body request the United States to bring its measures into conformity with its international obligations. Accordingly, in 2015, Congress repealed country of labeling provisions for beef and pork products.[57] In March 2016, USDA amended its COOL regulations, removing COOL requirements for beef and pork, to conform with the Congressional repeal.[58] In June 2017, cattle ranchers filed a lawsuit to revoke the USDA regulations and require COOL for annual imports of 800 million pounds of beef.[59]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COOL continues to apply to lamb, chicken, goat, and venison meat, certain fish, perishable commodities and some nuts.[60]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.2. Veterinary Feed Directive&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;US agriculture is a major user of antibiotics. Although many people think antibiotics are administered to treat sick pets or prevent bacteria from infecting other animals, a majority of antibiotics used in the United States are administered to food animals to speed weight gain or to improve feed efficiency.[61] These uses are often referred to as ‘production uses.’[62] Because some antibiotics administered to food animals are the same or similar to antibiotics prescribed for humans, production uses in animals contribute to the development of resistant bacteria.[63] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibiotic resistance in humans results in an estimated 700,000 global deaths each year, leading public health officials and policymakers to advocate restrictions on the use of nontherapeutic antibiotics in animal production.[64] The White House published a national action plan to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria and focused in part on ‘judicious use’ of antibiotics in agriculture, as well as in other healthcare settings.[65]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA, which governs drugs for humans and animals, issued guidance documents in 2012 and 2013 that established principles for changing the regulatory oversight of antibiotics used in agriculture.[66] The 2012 guidance document (Guidance 209) set out two guiding principles. First, ‘[t]he use of medically important antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals should be limited to those uses that are considered necessary for assuring animal health.’[67] That is, antibiotics should not be administered to promote growth. Second, ‘[t]he use of medically important antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals should be limited to those uses that include veterinary oversight or consultation.’[68] That is, veterinarians must prescribe certain antibiotic drugs for food animals. The 2013 guidance document (Guidance 213) indicated that the FDA planned to cooperate with pharmaceutical companies, so that production uses would no longer be approved label uses for medically important antibiotics. That document indicated that many over-the-counter antimicrobial drugs (antibiotics) used in feed will require veterinary supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the FDA amended its Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) regulations, which focus on the administration of nontherapeutic antibiotics in feed.[69] Animal feed that contains a VFD drug can be used only if a licensed veterinarian issues a written VFD order that authorizes the animal owner to use feed containing the VFD drug.[70] Once Guidance 213 is implemented fully, many more drugs will be considered VFD drugs. Therefore the amended regulations focus on controls for authorization, distribution, and use of these drugs. In addition, they improve the efficiency of the VFD process.[71]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While governmental attempts to control the use of nontherapeutic antibiotics should reduce production uses, consumers are requesting greater efforts.[72] They want a guarantee that their meat products are from animals that were raised without antibiotics.[73] This can be achieved with a labeling program if an oversight mechanism can ensure that the meat comes from animals that did not receive antibiotics. A labeling program with oversight would probably lead to minor increases in prices for meat products.[74]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vendors, stores, and restaurants are responding to consumer demands. Major meat vendors are implementing purchasing requirements under which producers must reduce or eliminate the use of antibiotics in animals that provide their products.[75] Much of the vendor action has occurred in the poultry industry due to the widespread use of nontherapeutic antibiotics in chickens.[76] Vendors are contracting with growers to abstain from using antibiotics so that they can label their products as antibiotic-free. Restaurants are also watching consumer preferences, and several chains have announced plans to sell meat only from chickens that are not raised with antibiotics.[77]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.3. Marketing Claims for Production without Hormones and Beta Agonists&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Producers administer hormones to a majority of cattle and swine produced in confined animal feeding operations. Some consumers, however, prefer meat products produced from animals that did not receive hormones.[78] In 2002, the USDA adopted provisions for marketing claims that allow products to be labeled ‘No added hormones’ if livestock never received supplemental hormones.[79] All meat products that are USDA certified organic (with an organic seal) will have come from animals that never received added hormones.[80]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some consumers also want to avoid meat products from animals that were administered beta agonists, especially ractopamine and zilpaterol.[81] The USDA has a ‘Never Fed Beta Agonists Program,’ allowing marketing claims that meat products come from animals that were not fed beta agonists.[82] USDA certified organic products will not come from animals that were administered beta agonists.[83]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.4. Production Standards for Certified Organic Livestock and Poultry&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2017, the USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service enacted a final rule to amend its regulation for production of organic livestock. The rule added requirements for humane animal practices, including livestock handling and transport, health care practices and procedures, and living conditions for mammals and poultry.[84] Its effective date was 20 March 2017. The current Administration has delayed the organic regulations to allow time for additional consideration, and the effective date is now 14 November 2017.[85]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the regulation is effective, livestock producers must comply with new requirements that limit physical alterations of animals. Procedures that are permitted (for the welfare of the animal, identification, or safety) must be performed at a reasonably young age with minimal pain or stress to the animal.[86] The regulation prohibits a number of practices. It prohibits tail docking of cattle and limits tail docking of sheep; tail docking in pigs is permitted only if other means to avoid harm failed.[87] Wattling and face branding of cattle are prohibited. Practices prohibited for organic poultry include de-beaking (except trimming before 10 days of age), de-snooding of turkeys, removing combs or wattles, caponizing (castrating) males, and trimming toes of chickens or turkeys (except at the hatchery with infrared).[88]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulation also imposes detailed requirements for living conditions of mammalian livestock and poultry. Conditions must ‘accommodate the wellbeing and natural behavior of animals.’[89] The regulation sets out detailed requirements for housing and other living conditions. For example, livestock must have year-round access to the outdoors, and continuous indoor confinement is prohibited. Similarly, the regulation establishes requirements for poultry housing and requires daily access to outdoor space. The regulation also imposes requirements for humane transport and slaughter of certified organic livestock and poultry.[90]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.5. Protection of Egg-Laying Hens: California Statutes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Americans object to production of eggs from hens housed in small wire ‘battery cages.’ No federal regulation prohibits the practice,[91] so consumers sought limitations at the state level. In 2008, a California ballot initiative approved a Farm Animal Cruelty law, effective in 2015, that makes it illegal to confine egg-laying hens in a way that prevents the hens from fully spreading both wings without touching the side of an enclosure or other egg-laying hens.[92]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, the California legislature enacted a provision to govern shelled eggs.[93] Declaring that eggs from hens exposed to stress are more likely to carry pathogens (e.g., salmonella), the law prohibits the sale of eggs for human consumption in California if those eggs come from hens at a farm not in compliance with provisions of the Farm Animal Cruelty law.[94] This legislation forced egg producers in California to remodel their laying facilities to provide more room for hens by reducing the numbers of birds in existing cages or installing new facilities with more space. Moreover, although some argue that the provision burdens interstate commerce and therefore violates the Commerce Clause of the US Constitution,[95] egg producers in other states are eliminating battery cages and providing more space for laying hens so they can sell eggs in California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A related, and arguably more important, development is voluntary action from companies selling eggs. Some corporate egg buyers and restaurant chains have announced that they will purchase only cage-free eggs.[96] It is estimated that retailers and restaurants accounting for 90 percent of the US egg market have made commitments to sell cage-free eggs at some time in the future.[97] While a debate continues on the merits of provisions requiring more space, marketing contracts are resulting in the elimination of battery cages. The changes in housing for egg-laying hens have increased productions costs and egg prices, especially in California.[98]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Food and the Environment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3.1. Insecticide Application and Bees&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The declining bee populations in many areas of the world is cause for alarm, because many crops depend on insects for pollination.[99] Perceived stressors of bees include the use of pesticides, as well as pathogens, parasites, and environmental degradation.[100] Neonicotinoids, which account for 25 percent of the global pesticide market,[101] have been a focus of attention.[102] Neonicotinoids are systemic insecticides sprayed on plants and absorbed and distributed throughout the plant. Systemic insecticides kill insects in two different ways. Insects die when they come into contact with the pesticide (e.g., during spray application) and also when they ingest the plant that has absorbed the pesticide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on the effect of application of neonicotinoids on bees is inconclusive.[103] In response to the hypothesis that neonicotinoids harm beneficial insects, however, the EU has restricted use of several neonicotinoids and is considering an outright ban.[104] The United States has not taken similar action. The state of Maryland became the first state to restrict the application of neonicotinoids by consumers, in the Pollinator Protection Act of 2016.[105]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pesticides containing sulfoxaflor are also controversial due to their potential adverse effects on bee populations. Like neonicotinoids, sulfoxaflor is a systemic insecticide. In 2015, environmental groups sued successfully to overturn the US EPA’s unconditional registration of sulfoxaflor.[106] Subsequently, the EPA granted emergency exemptions to use sulfoxaflor in limited situations.[107]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3.2. The Use of Glyphosate&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of glyphosate for the production of agricultural foodstuffs has raised significant concerns.[108] Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum herbicide registered to control annual and perennial weeds in various agricultural and non-agricultural settings.[109] Varieties of corn, soy, canola, and cotton, cultivated in the United States and globally, are genetically engineered to resist glyphosate. ‘Use of glyphosate-based herbicides … increased ~100-fold from 1974 to 2014.’[110] It may be the most heavily used herbicide in the world, with over 750 products containing glyphosate sold in the United States.[111]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous groups have analyzed environmental and human safety data and reached different conclusions. The World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer determined that glyphosate was a probable carcinogen.[112] Both the US EPA and the European Food Safety Authority, however, concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans.[113] Moreover, a review of independent research on the toxicity of glyphosate concluded it was not carcinogenic.[114] The EPA expects to conclude a complete human health study in 2017.[115] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies did not account for all of the factors&lt;span class="italic"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;that may adversely affect human health. For example, adjuvants or co-formulants used in the herbicides might increase the potency of glyphosate formulations, causing them to be more dangerous than reported studies indicate.[116] Some researchers assert that, in light of increased human exposure to glyphosate-based herbicides and other factors, safety standards for these herbicides are outdated and may not protect public health or the environment.[117] Indeed, responsible scientists have published a Statement of Concern that sets out current knowledge and uncertainties about the effects of glyphosate-based herbicides and recommends toxicological studies and monitoring glyphosate levels in humans and in the food supply.[118]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Food Safety&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4.1. Generally Recognized as Safe&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept termed ‘generally recognized as safe’ (GRAS), relevant to regulation of food additives under the FDCA, has long been controversial.[119] The 1958 Food Additives Amendment to the FDCA provides that a food additive is unsafe and considered adulterated unless it has complied with the FDA’s premarket approval process.[120] The FDCA definition of food additive excludes GRAS substances, so these substances are not considered food additives and are thus exempt from pre-market approval.[121] A determination that a substance is GRAS, however, requires ‘the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of a food additive.’[122]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GRAS attracted criticism because manufacturers themselves decided whether a new food substance was GRAS and were not required to inform the FDA about new GRAS substances. In 1997, the FDA issued a proposed GRAS rule, which would have established a voluntary notification procedure for GRAS substances.[123] Without enacting a final rule, the FDA implemented the notification procedure, and by 30 September 2016, the FDA had filed 678 GRAS notices on its website.[124] In 2010, the FDA re-opened the comment period for its 1997 proposed rule, but did not finalize the rule. Settlement of a lawsuit that challenged the FDA’s failure to finalize the rule required the FDA to promulgate its final GRAS rule by 31 August 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA promulgated its final GRAS Rule, effective in October 2017.[125] The GRAS Rule amends the FDA regulatory criteria for determining when a substance is GRAS, a determination that must be supported by scientific evidence. The GRAS rule establishes a voluntary GRAS notification process and prescribes a seven-part format for GRAS notifications, which must include scientific data and other information. On the basis of the notification, the FDA reviews the manufacturer’s data and informs the manufacturer whether the agency questions the basis of the GRAS determination. Although notification is voluntary, all manufacturers must meet the scientific criteria for determining that a substance is GRAS: ‘common knowledge throughout the scientific community … that there is reasonable certainty that the substance is not harmful under the conditions of its intended use.’[126] Moreover ‘scientific procedures [must] be based upon the application of generally available and accepted scientific data, information, or methods, which ordinarily are published, as well as the application of scientific principles.’[127] The FDA also issued a guidance for industry, intended to help manufacturers met the requirements for a GRAS determination.[128]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GRAS rule continues to engender controversy, especially because GRAS notification remains voluntary. In May 2017, several public interest groups challenged the 2016 GRAS rule, alleging that the rule, a ‘secret GRAS system,’ allows potentially unsafe food additives to enter the food supply without FDA review.[129]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4.2. FDA Ban on Industrially-Produced Trans Fat&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1950s, Fred Kummerow, a nutritional scientist from the University of Illinois, discovered high levels of trans fat in arteries of victims of heart disease and began to argue for restrictions on artificial trans fat. He petitioned the FDA for a ban in 2009 and finally sued the FDA in 2013. Kummerow, who died in May 2017 at 102 years old, lived to see the US FDA ban artificial trans fat in processed foods.[130]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trans fats are partially hydrogenated oils -- that is, industrially-produced trans fatty acids -- discovered in the early 20&lt;span class="superscript"&gt;th&lt;/span&gt; century. Trans fats also occur naturally in dairy products and meat from ruminant animals. In 2003, the FDA required information about trans fats in foods to appear on Nutrition Fact labels by 2006.[131] The use of trans fat decreased after 2003 because manufacturers reformulated some foods to eliminate or reduce trans fat, and a few state and local jurisdictions banned trans fat in restaurant food.[132]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the FDA banned industrially-produced partially hydrogenated oils (trans fats) from food, effective in June 2018.[133] Many trans fats -- for example, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oils -- had been considered GRAS substances and were not regulated as food additives. In banning trans fat, the FDA determined that scientific consensus no longer considered trans fats as GRAS for human food; scientific evidence found no safe level of consumption. Therefore, the FDA withdrew GRAS status from industrially-produced trans fats: ‘[Partially hydrogenated oils] are not GRAS for any use in human food.’[134] Food manufactures may still seek approval for use of partially hydrogenated oils as food additives, if data shows ‘a reasonable certainty of no harm.’[135] The FDA’s scientific evidence suggests that approval of trans fats as food additives is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDAs ban of industrially-produced trans fats offers significant health benefits to consumers. In the FDA’s calculation, those benefits far outweigh the costs to industry.[136] The FDA’s decision to ban artificial trans fats, after a century of consumption, has been called ‘the single most important change in our food supply,’ which ‘will save many thousands of lives each year.’[137]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, technological innovations have raised concerns about protection of human health and the environment. Advances in biotechnology have resulted in new products, but may demand reconsideration of decades-old regulatory systems. Traditional agriculture, including livestock production, must respond to consumer concerns about animal welfare, significant problems of antibiotic resistance, and other health concerns. Crop production, too, faces challenges from insecticides and herbicides with possible consequences for the environment and human health. Food safety remains critical, as the FDA enacts regulations to ensure that food ingredients are reasonably certain to be safe for consumers. New laws and regulations, discussed above, have addressed these issues. Agrarian law in the United States, as in other countries, must continue to respond to the challenges of providing food and fiber and protecting the environment for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><legacyfootnotes/><footnotes><footnote>1 Terence J.
