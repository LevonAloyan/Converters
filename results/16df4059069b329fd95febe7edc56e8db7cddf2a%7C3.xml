I want to say something this afternoon about the problems of arriving at and setting&#13;
in place an agrarian policy in contemporary Botswana. What I will say is necessarily&#13;
impressionistic and perhaps naive as Botswana is large (a country something like the&#13;
size of France, but with a population of under one million) and unexpectedly heterogeneous.&#13;
Further, in focussing on Botswana specifically, I want to make some general&#13;
points which will perhaps strike a chord for those whose experience and interests&#13;
lie in quite different places.&#13;
Rather than beginning with 'policy' and ending with its implementation I am&#13;
going to start at the wrong end and speak first of government itself. We should not&#13;
overlook the enormous ambitions of contemporary government. Early government&#13;
among the Tswana - like those in mediaeval Europe - contented itself with the&#13;
rather modest tasks of collecting revenue, making war and subduing its subjects.&#13;
Now, as everywhere except perhaps in contemporary Britain, the aim of government&#13;
stretches far beyond that, through enormous programmes of support, change and&#13;
amelioration. That is very ambitious. Consider the very project of legislation, that&#13;
important means through which government tells the world what it wants done.&#13;
Now even under optimum conditions, where do you have a homogeneous, unstratified&#13;
population, subscribing to a common universe of normative commitments,&#13;
communicating in a single language? The assumptions made in the project of legislation&#13;
must be seen as enormous: The very idea that the formulation and publication&#13;
of a written text can lead to desired, matching changes in the behaviour of a population&#13;
is perhaps extraordinary. It assumes common understandings and clear communication&#13;
between rulers and ruled, huge resources of trust and good will and/or&#13;
a formidable aparatus of enforcement. Obviously, the difficulties are multiplied&#13;
many times in a plural context, where the world appears very different depending&#13;
on whether you are at the centre or the periphery. The message is unlikely to be received&#13;
in anything like the form in which it was transmitted - and even if it arrivés&#13;
intact, how will it be received?&#13;
Now, Botswana is in every sense a plural context.&#13;
First, although a majority of the population is of Tswana origin, there are significant&#13;
non-Tswana minorities, and these minorities (themselves subjected to ancient&#13;
colonial domination by the Tswana before the period of European colonial expansion)&#13;
differ from the Tswana both in terms of language, political organisation, and&#13;
in terms of the way they go about making a living. While the Tswana were organised&#13;
as little kingdoms at the time of initial European contact, there were under the Tswana and adjacent to them, subject populations with acephalous organisational&#13;
arrangements, some entirely egalitarian like the Bushmen, others like the matrilineal&#13;
Yei had systems of organisation in which genealogical seniority was important. So&#13;
there was no one original political form in what came to be Botswana.</inleiding><content>While the Tswana herded cattle and were arable farmers too, the other groups were&#13;
either hunter/gatherers, or practised some form of shifting or settled agriculture.&#13;
So the land resources of what was to become Botswana were being exploited in a&#13;
range of different and potentially incompatible ways.&#13;
Second, by the middle of this century, even among the Tswana majority there were&#13;
great disparities in wealth, not perhaps along fixed lines of stratification, but of a&#13;
de facto nature: there were Tswana with huge herds of cattle, and those with none;&#13;
and there were Tswana keeping considerable tracts of land under cultivation and&#13;
those with tiny plots.&#13;
The way in which these disparities even among Tswana had become about was&#13;
complex. Tswana ideas about land allocation are overtly egalitarian - all are entitled&#13;
to as much arable land as they need, and all are f ree to graze their herds in these&#13;
common grazing areas into which the former kingdoms are divided up.1 The position&#13;
on the ground, however, is somewhat different. First, so f ar as grazing is concerned,&#13;
in this arid spot alongside and across the Kalahari desert, successful herding&#13;
depends on access to permanent water supplies - and these are generally boreholes,&#13;
which it has long been recognised, even in the common grazing areas, may be privately&#13;
owned. So those who were rich enough to exploit bore holes were able to command&#13;
the grazing for wide areas around them, for others entering the area had no&#13;
guarantee of water resources. In some areas combinations, syndicates, were formed;&#13;
but by and large, those who commanded the water resources developed and maintained&#13;
large herds on an increasingly commercial basis, while others tended to limp&#13;
along in a small way with no prospect of commercial success, on their own, or in&#13;
various forms of cliënt relations with the rich. Similarly, with arable farming, those&#13;
who had sufficient oxen to pull the plough, or beasts to sell for tractor purchase,&#13;
went ahead, while the remainder remained at subsistence, or in bad years, subsubsistence&#13;
levels.&#13;
So, by the time of independence in 1966, there were a small number of big Tswana&#13;
farmers, exploiting resources which were in theory available to all, to private advantage,&#13;
and a much larger number of Tswana whose operations were of a marginal&#13;
kind, even in the matter of supporting life. Not to mention the non-Tswana minorities,&#13;
and of these particularly the nomadic hunter/gatherers who were embattled,&#13;
as the areas where they lived had increasingly been penetrated by the Tswana herds&#13;
and many had more or less given up their traditional way of making a living, and&#13;
had become squatters in the vicinity of Tswana (or European) cattle posts, scraping&#13;
a living in a variety of menial ways.&#13;
So any policy-maker in Botswana was faced with a range of potentially conflicting&#13;
interests, some obvious, like the growing disparities among Tswana, some almost&#13;
unseen, like the plight of the Bushmen. On top of that was a serious ecological problem - as early as the 1930's it was generally agreed that the land resources in the&#13;
Tswana areas were significantly deteriorating - growing herds were already leading&#13;
to over-stocking, and to consequent serious overgrazing, specially in the areas of the&#13;
smaller former kingdoms. By the time of Independance in the 1960's major, longterm&#13;
damage had been inflicted, especially in the relatively crowded eastern side of&#13;
the country.&#13;
II.&#13;
In approaching these problems the Government articulated three concerns:&#13;
a. with social justice, the need to halt and reserve the growing disparities between&#13;
rich and poor;&#13;
b. with economie development;&#13;
c. and with conservation, preserving the land resources of Botswana for the future.&#13;
Here I shall confine myself to considering how grazing policy alone was formulated&#13;
and put into operation in the light of those aims.2 Here the choice went in favour&#13;
of an entirely new landmanagement scheme:&#13;
1. Some areas were to be leased to individuals on a commercial basis;&#13;
2. others were to remain under the 'traditional' systems of communal grazing;&#13;
3. the remainder was to be set aside for future needs.&#13;
The areas to be leased privately were to be fenced - a largely new development in&#13;
Tswana stock management - it being argued that only if people had private rights,&#13;
to be exploited commercially, would they have sufficient incentive to conserve and&#13;
improve the range. Further, by removing the large commercial farmers from the&#13;
communal areas, smaller stock holders would have a better chance there.&#13;
At first sight, these may seem to represent sensible measures for dealing with&#13;
Botswana's agrarian problems - but they were founded on a range of assumptions,&#13;
held by those at the centre, which were at best partically correct:&#13;
1. First, it was assumed that to the west of the main areas of population large virgin&#13;
lands were waiting to be carved up into commercial leasehold ranches.&#13;
2. Second, that within the former kingdom, there had been no adaptations towards&#13;
conservation, and that conservation of the range would be more effective under private&#13;
tenure.&#13;
3. That the larger farmers could be extracted without dislocation from their existing&#13;
situations in the communal land; that they could be seen as discreted from their less&#13;
fortunate comrades.&#13;
4. That fencing was necessary and desirable.&#13;
But these assumptions were largely unfounded: So far as the first of these points&#13;
was concerned, the western lands proposed for commercial grazing were not virgin.&#13;
Large tracts of them had alreay been exploited informally and boreholes sunk without&#13;
the knowledge of the government. More serious, they made up the surviving habitat of many of Botswana's hunter/gatherers, who were totally disregarded in the&#13;
allocation of commercial leases. They were either on the move in these areas, or living&#13;
as sedentary squatters around existing cattle camps. In either case, with the allocation&#13;
of commercial ranges, the assumption was that they would be re-located&#13;
- their needs, and rights, had been forgotten in the formulation of the policy. Few&#13;
of these communities had been consulted in the period leading up to the implementation&#13;
of the grazing policy, and many did not know about it until the time came&#13;
for them to be moved. So here there was a simple failure on the part of government&#13;
to survey the ground, relying, rather, on general assumptions some fourty years out&#13;
of date.&#13;
I will mention the problems surrounding fencing next. With the variable and unevenly&#13;
located rainfall in Botswana, the free movement of cattle had always been&#13;
an essential response. You took the cattle to the grazing areas where rain had fallen,&#13;
and where surface water was available. The demarcation of fenced ranches made&#13;
this traditional response impossible. There might be rich grazing within two or three&#13;
miles of your holding on account of a local storm, but the modern demarcation&#13;
placed that out of bounds. So there is some evidence that rigid boundary demarcation&#13;
may increase the deterioration of the range, rather than halt it.&#13;
Third was the problem of extracting the larger cattle holders from the communal&#13;
areas and locating them on commercial ranches. It has not everywhere proved possible&#13;
to do this, and in some areas the larger stock holders maintain camps round their&#13;
boreholes in the communal areas, and are developing ranches as well. Where they&#13;
have been persuaded to leave, this has had the effect of stranding large numbers of&#13;
people who had formerly existed in the communal lands in cliënt relations with&#13;
them, people who had hired stock from them, or who were herding for them. The&#13;
new commercial ranges, in other words, disregarded the traditional and neotraditional&#13;
network of support which had developed between rich and poor in the&#13;
communal areas. In locating 'tradition' in some imagined egalitarian past, government&#13;
disregarded ancient ties of obligation within a context of stratification and left&#13;
the poor stranded without their former sponsor, unable to survive as viable herders&#13;
without the cattle formerly loaned to them.&#13;
III.&#13;
The story I have told may seem a grim one, but perhaps the lesson is that our expectations&#13;
of government - and what government has come to feel we expect of it -&#13;
have become inflated. Entering on a scheme in a post-colonial world that is already&#13;
a lively, if scarcely understood, movement, a scène that is in no sense of the government's&#13;
own making and which has little relationship with classical accounts of&#13;
customary land tenure, with very limited resources to ascertain what is happening&#13;
on the ground or communicate with those on the periphery, a minimalist approach&#13;
could perhaps more easily be justified. The gradiose introduction of new forms of&#13;
tenure may not achieve effective social justice, economie development, or the preservation&#13;
and restoration of the range. To many in Botswana and outside, the setting&#13;
up of private fenced holdings, which has been at the core of the grazing policy, can be seen as entrenching and enhancing existing disparaties between rich and&#13;
poor. The fence is a potent symbol, not commonly linked to a fertile egalitarian&#13;
context.&#13;
Finally, not only government must be blamed. There are also the expatriate experts&#13;
- we ourselves sitting in this splendid building in Europe - who pay fleeting&#13;
visits in aeroplanes and readily proffer tendentious advice with glib confidence and&#13;
authority.</content><legacyfootnotes>1. See I. Schapera, A handbook of Tswana Law and Custom, London 1938.</legacyfootnotes><footnotes><footnote/></footnotes><auteurs>Prof. dr S.A.
