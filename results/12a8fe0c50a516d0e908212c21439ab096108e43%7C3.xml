Agriculture in the US National Legal Structure&#13;
The United States developed as an agrarian nation, but the Framers of the US Constitution, adopted in 1787, included no special provisions for agriculture. Indeed, the Constitution and its Amendments make no reference to agriculture. Producers and others involved in the agriculture industry, of course, enjoy the same constitutional rights and protections as other citizens.&#13;
Federal and state statutes and regulations govern both individual producers and agriculture as an industry, just as they govern other individuals and businesses. In addition, both the US Congress and state legislatures have enacted laws that apply specifically to agriculture. Federal law are codified in the United States Code,1 and each state has its own statutory codification. Legal principles of common law, established in court decisions, govern many agricultural issues, including contract and tort claims. Farmers, like others, are subject to common law tort suits to redress harm, including environmental damage, to persons or property.&#13;
The US Congress regularly enacts the federal Farm Bill, which authorizes various commodity programs (payments, loans, and other benefits), conservation programs, rural development, disaster assistance, agricultural research, nutrition, and other programs.2 Other federal statutes govern specialized aspects of agriculture, including packers and stockyards, livestock slaughter, meat and poultry inspection, organic production, plant protection, farmland protection, specific commodities, pesticides, and many other activities.3 Federal regulations, promulgated by administrative agencies (for example, the US Department of Agriculture, the US Environmental Protection Agency), implement statutory provisions. They are published for public comment in the Federal Register and codified in the Code of Federal Regulations.4&#13;
States enact statutes and promulgate regulations that apply within state borders. The ‘police power’ allows state regulation to protect and maintain public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. States often delegate police power authority to subdivisions like counties and municipalities. Although the doctrine of preemption5 applies to prevent state regulation in some areas regulated by federal law,6 states have broad authority to enact laws that affect agriculture and the environment.&#13;
The complex judicial system in the US gives no preference to agriculture and provides no specialized courts for agriculture. Agricultural disputes, like other cases, are heard in the appropriate federal or state trial court, and trial court judgments may be appealed. In fact, with a few exceptions, US courts do not normally specialize in agriculture or other areas.7&#13;
The jurisdiction of federal courts includes cases that raise federal questions (defined as ‘civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States’8) and cases between parties with diversity of citizenship (that is, when plaintiff and defendant are citizens of different states).9 Cases that involve issues under federal agricultural or environmental legislation, for example, may be filed in federal court. Each of the 50 States has its own court system. State courts have general jurisdiction and can decide any case properly filed. State statutes or common law often governs questions related to agriculture -- issues of land use or farm nuisance, for example.</inleiding><content>Administrative tribunals in federal agencies play a role in&#13;
resolving some agricultural issues, particularly disputes connected&#13;
with programs authorized by federal agricultural legislation.&#13;
For example, parties who receive an adverse decision&#13;
from an agency in the US Department of Agriculture&#13;
(USDA) have the right to appeal to the National Appeals Division&#13;
(NAD). The NAD acts independently of other USDA&#13;
agencies, and it reports to the Secretary of Agriculture. Federal&#13;
district courts hear appeals of final NAD determinations.&#13;

2. Land for Agricultural Production in&#13;
the United States&#13;
In the US, the majority of land is rural, and agriculture is a&#13;
major land use. The total land area is about 2.3 billion acres&#13;
(1 hectare is 2.469 acres). The federal government owns and&#13;
manages about 29 percent of US land (653 million acres),&#13;
primarily in Alaska and the mountainous West. More than&#13;
60 percent of US land (99 percent of cropland) is privately&#13;
owned.11 The 48 contiguous states (that is, excluding Alaska&#13;
and Hawaii) occupy about 1.9 billion acres, with 402 million&#13;
acres owned by the federal government. Almost 1.4 billion&#13;
acres are nonfederal rural land: cropland (357 million,&#13;
including 324 million acres of prime farmland), rangeland&#13;
(409 million), pasture (119 million), and forest (406 million).&#13;
Urban uses are only about a small percentage of total&#13;
US land.12&#13;
The USDA conducts a census of agriculture every five&#13;
years. The latest, the 2012 Census of Agriculture, closed officially&#13;
on 31 May 2013, and results are not yet available.13&#13;
Data from the 2007 Census of Agriculture indicated that&#13;
the US has 2.2 million farms. Land in farms is 922 million&#13;
acres, with an average farm size of 418 acres. The majority&#13;
of US farms are small, both in size and in value of sales.&#13;
About 1.7 million farms have sales of less than $50,000,&#13;
and 1.5 million are smaller than 180 acres; in contrast, about&#13;
116,000 farms have sales over $500,000, and 173,000 are&#13;
larger than 1000 acres.14&#13;
Agricultural production adds significant value to the US&#13;
economy. The USDA calculated that the value of agricultural&#13;
sector production in 2012 was $444.3 billion and forecast&#13;
a 2013 value of $471.7 billion. The value of crop production&#13;
in 2012 was $216.9 billion; livestock production, $170.4 billion;&#13;
services and forestry, $56.9 billion. After deduction of&#13;
various expenses, gross value added to the economy from&#13;
agriculture in 2012 was $206.2 billion. Net farm income&#13;
was $113.8 billion, with net farm income for 2013 forecast&#13;
at $131 billion.15&#13;
3. Regulation and Control of Agricultural&#13;
Production&#13;
3.1 Agricultural Legislation&#13;
Since the 1930s, US laws have authorized financial support&#13;
for agricultural producers and programs to encourage conservation&#13;
of farmland and other vulnerable rural land. The&#13;
Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 and the Agricultural&#13;
Act of 1949,16 with provisions that are now obsolete, constitute&#13;
much of the ‘permanent law’ that has governed US agricultural&#13;
policy. Later Farm Bills, with significant changes,&#13;
suspended application of the 1938 and 1949 laws. The US&#13;
Congress has enacted a major Farm Bill every few years (for&#13;
example,1985, 1990, 1996, 2002, 2008, with another scheduled&#13;
for 2012, but still under negotiation in late 2013).17&#13;
These federal Farm Bills, supplemented by other legislation,&#13;
establish policy for agriculture and related areas (for example,&#13;
nutrition, rural development, energy) until their provisions&#13;
expire.18 USDA agencies implement most federal farm&#13;
programs; the Farm Service Agency and the Natural Resources&#13;
Conservation Service play major roles.&#13;
The US Congress did not enact a new Farm Bill by 30 September&#13;
2012, the end of the federal fiscal year, when authority&#13;
under the 2008 Farm Bill for some programs and&#13;
their funding expired. In December 2012, Congress extended&#13;
most, but not all, major provisions of the 2008 Farm Bill&#13;
through 30 September 2013 or (for farm commodity programs)&#13;
through the end of the 2013 crop year.19&#13;
In Summer 2013, the US Senate and the House of Representatives&#13;
each passed its version of a new Farm Bill.20 By early&#13;
December, Congress had not yet reached the compromise&#13;
needed to enact a new Farm Bill. It seems likely, however,&#13;
that farm support under the a new Farm Bill will focus on&#13;
disaster assistance (crop insurance), some other commodity&#13;
support provisions will be repealed, and some environmental&#13;
programs will be amended or consolidated.&#13;
3.2 Effect of US Subsidies on the Environment&#13;
US Farm Bills have authorized support for producers&#13;
through programs such as commodity support (for example,&#13;
direct payments, counter cyclical payments, average&#13;
crop revenue election), loans, and disaster assistance. Since&#13;
1985, Farm Bills have also emphasized conservation and the&#13;
environment. Conservations programs are designed to encourage&#13;
agricultural practices that protect the environment.&#13;
Some commodity support provisions under recent Farm&#13;
Bills, however, have faced criticism for their environmental&#13;
impact.&#13;
3.2.1 Commodity Support&#13;
One criticism of US support for agriculture is that Farm&#13;
Bill programs, especially subsidies that support field crops,&#13;
have encouraged farmers to produce intensively, resulting in&#13;
‘large-scale monoculture megafarms.’21 These megafarms,&#13;
it is argued, affect water quality, degrade soil, decrease biodiversity&#13;
and habitat, cause air pollution, and contribute to&#13;
climate change.22 Others have noted that commodity support&#13;
has encouraged adoption of industrial-scale agriculture&#13;
and has thereby led to a ‘dramatic loss of agrobiodiversity,’&#13;
both in food crops and livestock, that may threaten food&#13;
supplies.23&#13;
The effect of Farm Bill support extends beyond intensive&#13;
crop production and may also encourage conversion of&#13;
grassland to cropland. Grassland includes land for hay, pasture,&#13;
and range; some is suitable for cultivation, but grassland&#13;
also provides wildlife habitat and offers environmental&#13;
benefits. Much native grassland in the US is in the Prairie&#13;
Pothole Region of the Northern Plains, a region with critical&#13;
habitat for migratory birds and for half of duck production&#13;
in North America.24&#13;
A government report published in 2007 concluded that federal&#13;
farm program payments were a significant factor in&#13;
farmers’ decisions to convert grassland to cropland.25 Interestingly,&#13;
conservation compliance (discussed below), which&#13;
applies to highly erodible land, does not prevent conversion&#13;
of grassland, because much grassland is not highly erodible.&#13;
26 More recently, USDA analyzed the role of selected&#13;
support programs in conversion of grassland to cropland between&#13;
1997 and 2007. The study concluded that disaster assistance,&#13;
crop insurance, and marketing loans (in that order&#13;
of significance) ‘increased land in cultivated crops by …&#13;
roughly 2.9 percent of cultivated cropland acreage.’27&#13;
To protect grasslands, the 2008 Farm Bill added a ‘sodsaver’&#13;
provision. A farmer who produces crops on more than&#13;
five acres of native sod, newly tilled to produce an annual&#13;
crop, is ineligible for certain federal crop and disaster insurance&#13;
benefits for the first five years of cultivation.28 In&#13;
the vulnerable Prairie Pothole Region, state governors must&#13;
elect to implement this provision, but no governor had opted&#13;
in by June 2011. If implemented, however, the sodsaver&#13;
provisions are likely to have only a ‘modest effect’ on landuse&#13;
decisions.29&#13;
3.2.2 Conservation Measures&#13;
3.2.2.1 Environmental Compliance&#13;
Conservation (environmental) compliance, introduced in&#13;
1985, protects both the environment and the long-term productivity&#13;
of US farmland. Producers who receive payments&#13;
under federal farm legislation (including commodity support&#13;
and conservation payments) must implement measures to&#13;
conserve highly erodible land and to protect wetlands from&#13;
conversion. Producers who fail to comply normally lose federal&#13;
farm program payments for all commodities and on all&#13;
land farmed by the producer. Conservation compliance is&#13;
voluntary, because farmers need not comply if they do not receive federal farm payments.30 For many farmers, however,&#13;
those payments are significant.31&#13;
Conservation compliance is designed to keep highly erodible&#13;
land in production, to protect soil productivity, and to&#13;
reduce off-site damage (for example, water pollution) from&#13;
soil erosion. To be eligible for farm program support, the&#13;
producer who cultivates highly erodible land must apply a&#13;
conservation plan using approved conservation systems. 32&#13;
These systems must be technically and economically feasible,&#13;
based on local conditions, and cost-effective; they must&#13;
not cause undue economic hardship to producers. Many approved&#13;
systems are inexpensive.33 These measures protect&#13;
farmland, and erosion from highly erodible land has declined&#13;
in recent years.34&#13;
Environmental compliance also protects wetlands. For decades,&#13;
government policy encouraged and supported drainage&#13;
and clearing of wetlands for cultivation, and nearly half&#13;
of US wetlands have been drained, primarily for agricultural&#13;
use.35 To protect wetlands from further loss, the ‘swampbuster’&#13;
provision makes producers ineligible for certain federal&#13;
farm program benefits if they produce commodities on&#13;
converted wetlands after 1985 or convert wetlands for crop&#13;
production after 1990.36 USDA estimated that this provision&#13;
protects between 1.5 and 3.3 million acres of wetlands vulnerable&#13;
to conversion.37&#13;
Environmental compliance offers significant protection to&#13;
rural land and the environment. If a new farm bill replaces&#13;
direct payments and other commodity support programs&#13;
with subsidized federal disaster insurance, many producers&#13;
would have less incentive for environmental compliance.38&#13;
An authoritative organization recommended strongly that&#13;
conservation compliance, which ‘discourages the adverse&#13;
use of farmland,’ be a requirement of any new ‘revenue assurance&#13;
program’ enacted by Congress in the next Farm&#13;
Bill.39 Nonetheless, the connection between environmental&#13;
compliance and eligibility for disaster insurance has engendered&#13;
controversy.&#13;
3.2.2.2 Voluntary programs&#13;
US agricultural legislation has also included financial and&#13;
technical incentives for conservation, as well as voluntary&#13;
programs that support conservation practices. Since&#13;
1985, Farm Bills have supported land retirement and encouraged&#13;
conservation practices on working land. Because&#13;
a new Farm Bill may amend and consolidate conservation&#13;
programs, this Article describes programs authorized by the&#13;
2008 Farm Bill only briefly.&#13;
The Conservation Reserve Program retires environmentally&#13;
sensitive cropland from production.40 In exchange for annual&#13;
rental payments, landowners, operators, or tenants enter&#13;
10- to 15-year contracts with the federal government.&#13;
They retire eligible land from agricultural use, implement&#13;
an approved conservation plan, and plant approved vegetative&#13;
cover. The federal government offers technical assistance&#13;
and shares the cost of establishing conservation practices&#13;
required by contract.41 A smaller Wetlands Reserve&#13;
Program protects farmed or converted wetlands through permanent&#13;
or 30-year easements, restoration cost-share agreements,&#13;
or both.42&#13;
USDA conservation programs for working lands help eligible&#13;
producers to implement conservation measures that&#13;
protect the environment.43 The Environmental Quality Incentives&#13;
Program (EQIP)44 promotes good environmental practices and helps producers to comply with regulatory&#13;
requirements concerning soil, water, and air quality and&#13;
to protect wildlife habitat and conserve water. By contract,&#13;
producers agree to implement conservation practices under&#13;
an EQIP conservation plan, in exchange for payments for income&#13;
foregone and for costs of implementation of conservation&#13;
practices and installation of conservation structures.&#13;
The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP),45 a voluntary&#13;
payment-for-performance program, encourages farmers&#13;
to improve, maintain, and manage current conservation&#13;
activities and to undertake additional conservation practices.&#13;
Producers who qualify for enrollment enter stewardship&#13;
contracts, which require implementation of a conservation&#13;
stewardship plan on their whole farming operation. Annual&#13;
payments reflect the value of environmental benefits from&#13;
their conservation practices.46&#13;
Farm Bill conservation programs protect the soil, air, and&#13;
water. But in addition, as the USDA noted, ‘[a]griculture&#13;
could play a prominent role in U.S. efforts to address climate&#13;
change if farms and ranches undertake activities that&#13;
reduce greenhouse gas … emissions or take greenhouse gases&#13;
out of the atmosphere.’47 In 2011, agriculture contributed&#13;
eight percent of US greenhouse gas emissions, especially&#13;
methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), but some agricultural&#13;
land uses helped to sequester carbon.48 USDA conservation&#13;
programs encourage and support sustainable practices&#13;
in both crop and livestock production that help to mitigate&#13;
climate change and sequester carbon. Indeed, a federal report&#13;
indicated that both the Conservation Reserve Program&#13;
and EQIP help to mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases.&#13;
49 Environmental practices like conservation tillage and&#13;
careful nutrient management can reduce N2O emissions; improved&#13;
management of livestock and manure can reduce&#13;
CH4 emissions. Federal law offers financial incentives for&#13;
adoption of improved technologies (for example, methane&#13;
recovery). Agricultural and forest lands sequester carbon,&#13;
taking greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere and offsetting&#13;
emissions. USDA programs that retire land, protect wetlands,&#13;
and preserve grasslands encourage sequestration of&#13;
carbon, as do programs that encourage conservation practices&#13;
(for example, no till, windbreaks) on working land.50&#13;
3.3 Traditional Farms and Industrially-&#13;
Organized Units&#13;
3.3.1 Trend toward Intensification&#13;
In the US, large farms are critical for agricultural production,&#13;
and farming has intensified in recent decades.51 The&#13;
average farm size decreased between 1990 and 2010, from&#13;
460 to 418 acres,52 reflecting the fact that many farms are&#13;
small life-style or retirement farms that produce little agricultural&#13;
income. Nonetheless, USDA research found that between&#13;
1982 and 2007, production ‘shifted to larger farms&#13;
that are more likely to be profitable, better able to adopt&#13;
new technologies, and more likely to use production or marketing&#13;
contracts.’53 In 1991, farms that produced less than&#13;
$250,000 represented 36 percent of total production; in&#13;
2009, only 16 percent. Also in 1991, farms that produced&#13;
over $1 million were 21 percent of total production; in 2009,&#13;
39 percent.54&#13;
For purposes of research and reporting, the Economic Research&#13;
Service of the USDA developed a farm typology.&#13;
ERS revised its typology in April 2013 to recognize inflation&#13;
in commodity prices and the shift in production to&#13;
larger farms.55 The ERS now defines farm types by gross&#13;
cash farm income (GCFI), instead of gross farm sales. This change includes more types of farm income (for example,&#13;
timber sales, outdoor recreation) and allows more accurate&#13;
estimation of income from contracts for production of livestock&#13;
(hogs and poultry).&#13;
The revised typology classifies some small family farms&#13;
with GCFI less than $350,000 as retirement farms or offfarm&#13;
occupation farms. Other small farming-occupation&#13;
farms are low-sales (GCFI less than $150,000) or moderatesales&#13;
(GCFI between $150,000 and $349,999). Midsize family&#13;
farms (a new category) have GCFI between $350,000&#13;
and $999,999. The typology classifies large-scale family&#13;
farms, with GCFI of $1 million or more, as either large&#13;
farms ($1 million to $4,999,999) or very large farms ($5&#13;
million or more). Nonfamily farms have no sales criteria.56&#13;
3.3.2 Legal Distinctions between Farm Sizes&#13;
In general, environmental and other laws that govern agricultural&#13;
enterprises apply regardless of size. In a few instances,&#13;
however, the applicability of environmental regulations&#13;
depends on the size of the operation or the level of&#13;
emissions.&#13;
For example, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations&#13;
under the Clean Air Act impose requirements for&#13;
mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions on the basis&#13;
of emission levels. Under these regulations, livestock facilities&#13;
with manure management systems must report if&#13;
their combined CH4 and N2O emissions are equivalent to&#13;
25,000 metric tons CO2e per year. The EPA calculated that&#13;
reporting would be required for beef facilities with an average&#13;
annual population of more than 29,300 animals; dairy,&#13;
3,200; swine, 34,100.57 The EPA cannot require reporting&#13;
under this regulation, however, because Congress has prohibited&#13;
the expenditure of funds to require reporting from&#13;
livestock facilities.58 Similarly, the Clean Water Act requires&#13;
permits for concentrated animal feeding operations, based&#13;
on size and discharge. These requirements are discussed below.&#13;
4. Environmental Rules for Agricultural&#13;
Production&#13;
In the US, as in the EU, farming depends on healthy soil,&#13;
water, and air for production of crops and livestock. But agriculture&#13;
itself, especially intensive production, is a significant&#13;
source of pollution. Nutrients and chemicals from crop&#13;
production reach surface and ground waters. Indeed, a ‘dead&#13;
zone’ (a low-oxygen area), sometimes as large as 8,500&#13;
square miles, in the Gulf of Mexico at the mouth of the Mississippi&#13;
River is due, in large part, to nitrogen and phosphorus&#13;
from agricultural runoff.59 Wastes from intensive livestock&#13;
production cause water pollution, and emissions of&#13;
pollutants and odors result in air pollution.&#13;
US environmental laws have not been entirely effective in&#13;
regulating pollution from many agricultural activities. Although&#13;
the polluter pays principle suggests that agriculture&#13;
should be subject to environmental regulation like other industries,&#13;
60 agriculture is exempt from some environmental&#13;
requirements that apply to other industries.61 In some instances,&#13;
statutes provide explicit exemptions for agriculture.&#13;
In others, the nature of agricultural pollution, which often&#13;
results from diffuse land uses, makes regulation difficult.&#13;
4.1 Clean Water Act&#13;
The Clean Water Act (CWA)62 require permits for point&#13;
sources of water pollution under the National Pollutant Discharge&#13;
Elimination System.63 The CWA defines point sources&#13;
broadly. It defines a ‘concentrated animal feeding operation’&#13;
(CAFO) as a point source, but excludes ‘agricultural&#13;
stormwater discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture.’&#13;
64 Moreover, the CWA prohibits requirement of an&#13;
NPDES permit for ‘discharges composed entirely of return&#13;
flows from irrigated agriculture.’65 Thus, the CWA does not&#13;
regulate significant discharges from arable farming that result&#13;
in water pollution.&#13;
4.1.1 CAFOs&#13;
EPA regulations for CAFOs under the NPDES system include&#13;
national effluent limitation guidelines and standards as&#13;
well as permit requirements.66 CAFO regulations have been&#13;
controversial, and appellate court decisions vacated portions&#13;
of EPA regulations promulgated in 2003 and amended in 2008.67 Current EPA permit regulations, amended to comply&#13;
with court orders, state that ‘a CAFO must not discharge unless&#13;
the discharge is authorized by an NPDES permit,’ and&#13;
the CAFO must have the permit at the time it discharges.68&#13;
Discharges that result from land application of livestock&#13;
wastes are also subject to the permit requirement.69 EPA effluent&#13;
limitations generally apply to Large CAFOs (1000 or&#13;
more animal units); with some exceptions (for example, significant&#13;
precipitation), the guidelines allow no discharge.&#13;
Certain Large CAFOs must comply with best management&#13;
practices for land application; they must develop and maintain&#13;
a site-specific nutrient management plan that makes agronomic&#13;
use of wastes and minimizes movement of nitrogen&#13;
and phosphorus to surface waters.70 Because the permit requirement&#13;
applies only to CAFOs that discharge, relatively&#13;
few livestock facilities actually require permits under EPA&#13;
regulations.71 Nonetheless, the EPA recently indicated plans&#13;
to make CAFOs one of its six national enforcement initiatives&#13;
for 2014-2016. Moreover, the EPA’s Criminal Enforcement&#13;
Alerts are intended to make the public aware of possible&#13;
criminal enforcement against CAFOs whose operators&#13;
knowingly or negligently discharge pollutants in violation of&#13;
the CWA or its regulations.72&#13;
4.1.2 Nonpoint Sources&#13;
Under the CWA, facilities that are not point sources of water&#13;
pollution are considered nonpoint sources. Thus, livestock&#13;
facilities not defined as CAFOs (that is, the majority of livestock&#13;
operations) and runoff from cropland are nonpoint&#13;
sources of pollution. The CWA requires state assessment,&#13;
disclosure, and management programs for nonpoint pollution.&#13;
73 Little direct regulation, however, means that many&#13;
emissions from agriculture escape regulation. Although a&#13;
few states require farmers to apply measures to limit erosion,&#13;
most states offer incentives to encourage best management&#13;
practices, often identified or recommended by the federal&#13;
EPA or USDA, to prevent nonpoint source pollution.74&#13;
Nonpoint pollution from agriculture may also be regulated&#13;
by the CWA Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) provision,&#13;
which applies to both point and nonpoint pollution.75&#13;
Under this provision, states are directed to identify impaired&#13;
water bodies and their maximum loads of pollutants. States&#13;
must then implement plans to reduce pollutants from impaired&#13;
water bodies. States have been reluctant to apply TMDLs&#13;
to govern runoff from agriculture.&#13;
4.1.3 Biosolids (Sewage Sludge)&#13;
The Clean Water Act authorizes the EPA to regulate sewage&#13;
sludge.76 Under EPA regulations, many requirements apply&#13;
to those who prepare biosolids for application and those&#13;
who operate surface disposal sites or incinerators. Biosolids&#13;
that meet stringent standards for pollutants, pathogens,&#13;
and attractiveness to vectors (insects, rodents) are considered&#13;
‘exceptional quality.’ Because exceptional quality sewage&#13;
sludge is ‘considered comparable to standard fertilizer&#13;
products,’ no specific requirements apply for land application.&#13;
77 If sewage sludge does not meet these standards, land&#13;
appliers must follow regulatory retirements. For example,&#13;
the amount of bulk sewage sludge applied to agricultural or&#13;
forest land must not exceed the agronomic rate for nitrogen&#13;
or cumulative pollutant rates prescribed by regulation. Other&#13;
restrictions apply, including prohibitions on application to&#13;
flooded, frozen, or snow-covered land or to land less than 10&#13;
meters from US waters.78 States and political subdivisions&#13;
may impose additional or more stringent requirements for&#13;
use of biosolids.79&#13;
4.2 Coastal Zone Management Act&#13;
State programs enacted under the Coastal Zone Management&#13;
Act80 may also impose requirements on agricultural&#13;
operations. The law encourages states to preserve and protect&#13;
coastal areas; one important goal is to protect coastal&#13;
waters from nonpoint source pollution. States with federally-approved coastal zone management programs must have&#13;
programs to control nonpoint pollution.81 An EPA guidance&#13;
document specifies management measures and practices to&#13;
achieve those measures, appropriate for agricultural sources,&#13;
including erosion, nutrients, pesticides, irrigation, and livestock&#13;
confinement or grazing.82 State programs are subject&#13;
to federal approval; one state program, for example, relies&#13;
on best management practices for agriculture, with enforcement&#13;
options for noncompliance.83&#13;
4.3 Clean Air Act&#13;
Livestock facilities emit particulate matter, gases (including&#13;
methane, a greenhouse gas), vapors, and odors from confinement&#13;
buildings, manure storage facilities, and land application&#13;
of waste. Air emissions from livestock facilities include&#13;
pollutants (for example, particulate matter, a criteria&#13;
pollutant) regulated by the federal Clean Air Act (CAA).84&#13;
Major sources of regulated air pollutants must normally obtain&#13;
operating permits, but few livestock facilities have been&#13;
required to obtain permits, in part because calculating air&#13;
emissions from livestock facilities is difficult.85 In 2005,&#13;
the EPA established a voluntary Air Compliance Agreement&#13;
with livestock producers. Participating livestock farms (over&#13;
90 percent of the largest US operations),86 considered to be&#13;
in regulatory compliance during the study, helped to fund research&#13;
on emissions data from animal confinement structures&#13;
as well as manure storage and treatment units. A twoyear&#13;
study monitored 24 facilities in nine states.87 Using&#13;
data from the study, the EPA has developed emissions estimating&#13;
methodologies.88 In March 2012, the EPA published&#13;
and requested comments on draft documents that developed&#13;
methods for estimating emissions for broiler operations and&#13;
for lagoons and basins at swine and dairy operations.89 Livestock&#13;
facilities will use the EPA’s final emissions estimating&#13;
methodologies to determine their obligations under the CAA&#13;
and their reporting responsibilities under CERCLA and EPCRA.&#13;
4.4 CERC LA and EPCR A&#13;
Several US environmental laws require facilities to report&#13;
the ‘release’ of certain hazardous substances into the environment.&#13;
Both CERCLA (the Superfund law)90 and EPCRA91&#13;
require reporting of releases of hazardous substances,&#13;
including hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and phosphorus.92&#13;
Some releases from agriculture are exempt from reporting&#13;
by statute. CERCLA does not include the ‘normal application&#13;
of fertilizer’ in its definition of release,93 and EPCRA&#13;
defines as hazardous chemicals neither substances&#13;
used in routine agriculture operations nor fertilizer.94 After&#13;
a petition from industry and significant study, the EPA&#13;
enacted an administrative exemption for air release of hazardous&#13;
substances from animal waste. Under CERCLA, the&#13;
EPA exempted from reporting ‘[r]eleases to the air of any&#13;
hazardous substance from animal waste at farms.’95 Under&#13;
EPCRA, the EPA exempted from reporting releases from animal&#13;
waste at all farms, except those classified as Large CAFOs&#13;
under the Clean Water Act.96 These exemptions mean&#13;
that relatively few farms must report emissions of hazardous&#13;
substances.&#13;
4.5. Endangered Species Act&#13;
The Endangered Species Act97 applies to farmers, like other&#13;
land users, and may require preservation of habitat for endangered&#13;
species. Under the ESA, it is unlawful for any person&#13;
to ‘take’ an endangered species of fish or wildlife; the&#13;
term ‘take’ is defined as ‘harass, harm, pursue, hunt,’ and&#13;
other actions.98 Moreover, a regulatory definition states that&#13;
‘[h]arm in the definition of “take” ... means an act which actually&#13;
kills or injures wildlife. Such act may include significant&#13;
habitat modification or degradation where it actually&#13;
kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding or sheltering.’&#13;
99 Thus, under the ESA and its regulations, the prohibition&#13;
against taking may require preservation of habitat of&#13;
an endangered species on private land, including agricultural&#13;
land.100&#13;
5. Planning Provisions and Mandatory&#13;
Licenses&#13;
5.1 Zoning&#13;
Local governments in the US generally control the use of&#13;
privately-owned land. States have authority to govern land&#13;
use under their general police power, but only a few states&#13;
have enacted statewide land-use plans. Instead, most states&#13;
delegate zoning authority to counties and municipalities,&#13;
which enact ordinances for their jurisdictions. Zoning often&#13;
involves a comprehensive land-use plan, supplemented by&#13;
a zoning map that identifies land-use districts, with the uses&#13;
and densities permitted in the districts. Although rural land&#13;
can be subject to zoning restrictions, the majority of rural&#13;
land is not zoned. Farms and other activities are often free&#13;
to choose any appropriate location, unless other limitations&#13;
(see 5.2 below) apply.&#13;
When rural land is zoned, the purpose is often to protect&#13;
land for agriculture by identifying agricultural zones and restricting&#13;
incompatible activities in those zones. To keep land&#13;
in agricultural use, ordinances may impose exclusive agricultural&#13;
zoning, which prevents development of agricultural&#13;
land; area-based zoning, which sets density restrictions;&#13;
cluster zoning, which allows development on a small parcel&#13;
of farmland; or minimum lot size zoning.101&#13;
Some states have limited the authority of zoning officials to&#13;
restrict agricultural activities. In Illinois, for example, a statute&#13;
provides that county zoning authority may not be exercised&#13;
to ‘impose regulations, eliminate uses, buildings, or&#13;
structures, or require permits with respect to land used for&#13;
agricultural purposes.’102 But Illinois counties may require&#13;
agricultural buildings and structures to comply with building&#13;
or set-back lines and may establish minimum lot sizes&#13;
for residences on agricultural land. Other states have similar&#13;
provisions.103&#13;
5.2 Licenses, Certifications, and Permits&#13;
In general, US agricultural producers can operate freely,&#13;
without securing a license required of other professionals&#13;
(for example, lawyers, veterinarians, physicians, and many&#13;
other occupations) under state law. In some situations, federal&#13;
and state laws require registration or licenses for activities&#13;
related to agriculture. For example, pesticide manufacturing&#13;
facilities must be registered under FIFRA.104 States require&#13;
licenses for grain dealers and warehouses, livestock dealers,&#13;
and other businesses that buy or sell farm products.105&#13;
5.2.1 Certifications&#13;
Certifications play a role in US agriculture. Under the US&#13;
Organic Food Production Act,106 for example, certification&#13;
ensures that products certified as organic meet stringent production&#13;
standards. This Act established the National Organic&#13;
Standards Board, which promulgated comprehensive national&#13;
standards.107 Under the certification program, agents accredited&#13;
by the USDA ensure that producers meet statutory&#13;
and regulatory requirements.&#13;
National Organic Program (NOP) standards prohibit the&#13;
use of specified substances, methods (including genetic engineering),&#13;
and ingredients in organic crop production and&#13;
handling. Products labeled as organic may not use excluded&#13;
methods,108 and producers must follow an approved organic&#13;
system plan and avoid unintentional contact with unapproved&#13;
substances. Those who handle organic products must&#13;
also ‘prevent the commingling of organic and nonorganic&#13;
products and protect organic products from contact with&#13;
prohibited substances.’109&#13;
NOP standards also apply to organically-produced livestock&#13;
and their products, which must come from animals ‘under&#13;
continuous organic management from the last third of gestation&#13;
or hatching.’110 Feed for livestock sold as organic must&#13;
generally be produced organically, and the producer may not&#13;
use animal drugs or hormones to promote growth.111 Livestock&#13;
living conditions must ‘accommodate the health and&#13;
natural behavior of animals.’112&#13;
A small farmer or handling operation, whose annual income&#13;
from organic sales is $5,000 or less, can sell products as organic without following all federal organic requirements.&#13;
The small farmer must follow production, handling, and labeling&#13;
requirements, but is exempt from certification and&#13;
need not submit an organic system plan.113 This exemption&#13;
is significant in light of the number of small farms in the&#13;
US.&#13;
5.2.2 Permits&#13;
Federal environmental laws require permits for some polluting&#13;
activities. As the discussion above indicated, both the&#13;
Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act require some facilities&#13;
that emit pollutants to operate under permits. Environmental&#13;
statutes often authorize cooperative federalism, under&#13;
which states may choose to meet federal requirements to&#13;
issue and enforce permits in their own jurisdictions.&#13;
State laws often impose additional permit requirements for&#13;
agricultural activities that pose risks to the environment or&#13;
have the potential to interfere with neighbors. Many states&#13;
govern the location, construction, and operation of large&#13;
livestock facilities. The majority of states (32, according to a&#13;
2002 study) require permits for construction or operation of&#13;
livestock facilities, in addition to NPDES permits. Although&#13;
state requirements vary significantly, some impose standards&#13;
that are more strict than federal NPDES requirements.114&#13;
For example, the Illinois Livestock Management Facilities&#13;
Act115 recognizes the trend toward larger concentrations of&#13;
animals and their excrement at livestock management facilities&#13;
and their potential impact on neighbors and the environment.&#13;
Therefore, it establishes criteria for the location&#13;
of facilities to protect environmentally sensitive areas,&#13;
avoid environmental damage, and control odors. Required&#13;
setbacks are based on size. Large facilities (over 7000 animal&#13;
units: for example, 7000 cattle, 17,500 swine over 55&#13;
pounds) must be located at least one-half mile from an occupied&#13;
residence and one mile from a populated area. The&#13;
county or its residents can request a public informational&#13;
meetings for facilities serving 1000 or more animal units or&#13;
those that will store waste in earthen lagoons. The law also&#13;
sets standards for the design of earthen lagoons, concrete&#13;
storage structures, and other waste handling structures. It requires&#13;
inspection, registration, and certification of facilities.&#13;
Facilities with 300 or more animal units must be supervised&#13;
by a certified livestock manager.116&#13;
Waste management plans, required for facilities with 1000&#13;
or more animal units, must provide for application of livestock&#13;
wastes at agronomic rates for nitrogen and phosphorus.&#13;
Livestock sludge, removed periodically from the lagoon,&#13;
must be tested for nutrient content, and its application&#13;
must also meet soil nutrient requirements. Other restrictions&#13;
on land application apply.117&#13;
6. Nuisance&#13;
Agricultural production, especially intensive farming, may&#13;
interfere with the use and enjoyment of other land. Odors&#13;
from animals and manure, fertilizers, dust, insect, application&#13;
of pesticides and herbicides, and noise may raise claims&#13;
of nuisance even in rural areas. Nuisance law has offered a&#13;
remedy when agricultural activities interfere unreasonably&#13;
with a neighbor’s use and enjoyment of land, injure life or&#13;
health, or interfere with public rights.118 Private nuisance results&#13;
from interference with the plaintiff’s use and enjoyment&#13;
of land; it is ‘a nontrespassory invasion of another’s&#13;
interest in the private use and enjoyment of land.’119 In contrast,&#13;
a public nuisance interferes with land use of a large&#13;
number of plaintiffs or with public rights; it is therefore ‘an&#13;
unreasonable interference with a right common to the general&#13;
public.’120 Nuisance is an intentional tort if defendant’s&#13;
use of land caused plaintiff to suffer substantial and unreasonable&#13;
interference with use of property, and defendant&#13;
had knowledge (‘civil intent’) that its activities would injure&#13;
plaintiffs. In contrast, negligent nuisance requires proof that&#13;
defendant’s activities on its own land (rather than the interference&#13;
with plaintiff) were unreasonable.121 Remedies in&#13;
nuisance suits include injunctions against specific activities&#13;
and awards of monetary damages.&#13;
Nuisance is generally a matter of state common law and focuses&#13;
on reasonable use of land in light of the circumstances.&#13;
Although both farmers and their neighbors have the right&#13;
to reasonable use and enjoyment of their property, since the&#13;
late 1970s, every US state has enacted right to farm legislation.&#13;
122 These laws, originally intended to keep farmland in&#13;
agricultural use, protect farmers from nuisance litigation resulting&#13;
from changes in surrounding land uses. State statutes&#13;
impose different requirements for protection. In the typical&#13;
statute, a farm that has operated for at least a year cannot become&#13;
a private or public nuisance because of changed conditions&#13;
in the surrounding area, typically when the plaintiff&#13;
comes to the nuisance. Statutes may require that the farm&#13;
not be a nuisance at the outset and that its operation not be&#13;
negligent or improper. Some statutes discourage nuisance&#13;
suits by providing that a defendant who prevails in the suit&#13;
can collect costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, from the plaintiff.123 Right to farm laws have deterred&#13;
nuisance suits against farm operations. They raise&#13;
constitutional issues, however, and a few courts have found&#13;
right-to-farm statutes unconstitutional.124&#13;
7. Conclusion&#13;
US agricultural producers, who farm millions of acres of&#13;
land, provide food and fiber for citizens of the US and of&#13;
the world. Agriculture relies on healthy soil, water, and air&#13;
for production, and farmers are responsible for stewardship&#13;
of their land to ensure continued productivity and to protect&#13;
the environment. Nonetheless, some farm practices, especially&#13;
from intensive agriculture, emit pollutants to the surrounding&#13;
environment. Although the US has a sophisticated&#13;
system of environmental laws, agriculture has been subject&#13;
to fewer environmental restrictions than other industries, in&#13;
part because some agricultural emissions are difficulty to&#13;
quantify. Some, but not all, US environmental laws exclude&#13;
agriculture from requirements that apply to other industries&#13;
or include less burdensome provisions for agriculture. Moreover,&#13;
both federal and state laws have avoided regulation,&#13;
relying instead on incentives, including financial and technical&#13;
assistance, to encourage farmers to apply good environmental&#13;
practices.125&#13;
In recent years, however, the trend toward megafarms and&#13;
intensive animal production has raised public awareness of&#13;
the environmental effects of agriculture. Moreover, research&#13;
and technical advances will allow more accurate measurement&#13;
of emissions from farms, particularly livestock facilities.&#13;
These developments may result in stricter regulation of&#13;
agricultural producers and enforcement of existing standards&#13;
on more agricultural operations.&#13;
Postscript&#13;
After long delay, the US Congress passed the Agricultural Act&#13;
of 2014 (the 2014 Farm Bill) in February 2014, and President&#13;
Obama signed the Farm Bill into law. The twelve Titles of the&#13;
lengthy law establish US agriculture and nutrition policy for&#13;
the next five years. Among many significant changes, the&#13;
Agricultural Act of 2014 repeals direct payments and countercyclical&#13;
payments for commodoties (Title I); it strengthens&#13;
crop insurance to protect farmers from risk (Title XI). The&#13;
law (§ 2611) imposes (somewhat weakened) environmental compliance&#13;
requirements, both for highly erodible land and wetlands,&#13;
on producers who receive federal subsidies for crop insurance.&#13;
The 2014 Farm Bill (Title II) amends and consolidates conservation&#13;
programs mentioned in this Article (at 3.2 above); the law&#13;
reduces the number of conservation programs from 23 to 13.&#13;
The Conservation Reserve Program (§§ 2001-2008) is amended&#13;
and authorized through 2018, but hte maximum enrollment will&#13;
be reduced in steps to 24 million acres in 2017. An Agricultural&#13;
Conversation Easement Program (§ 2301) combines the functions&#13;
of the now-repealed Wetlands Reserve, Grassland Reserve,&#13;
and Farmland Protection Programs. The Farm Bill amended the&#13;
Conservation Stewardship Program (§ 2101), with an enrollment&#13;
goal of 10 million acres each year through 2022. The Environmental&#13;
Quality Incentives Program (§§ 2201-2208) is reauthorized&#13;
and now includes conservation practises that support wildlife&#13;
habitat. The Wildlife Habitat Incentive program is repealed.&#13;
A new Regional Conversation Partnership Program (§ 2401) consolidates&#13;
conservation programs that protect soil and water quality&#13;
and wildlife habitat in regions or watersheds. The Agricultural&#13;
Act repealed a number of other existing conservation programs;&#13;
transition provisions protect current participants (§§ 2701-2713).</content><legacyfootnotes>* Professor Emerita and Bock Chair in Agricultural Law Emerita, University of Illinois, USA.

payments. T. Kirk White &amp; Robert A. Hoppe, Changing&#13;

(permit requirements). An animal feeding operation is a lot&#13;
or facility where animals are confined and fed for at least&#13;
45 days in a 12-month period and where vegetation is not&#13;
present during the normal growing season. A CAFO is an&#13;
animal feeding operation that is ‘defined as a Large CAFO federalor&#13;

must apply for an individual permit or be covered under&#13;
a general permit. Most states have authority to implement&#13;
the NPDES permit program for CAFOs within their borders.&#13;
69. 40 CFR § 122.23(e). When the CAFO owner or operator&#13;
applies manure, litter, or process wastewater ‘in accordance&#13;
with site specific nutrient management practices,’ a&#13;
‘precipitation-related discharge’ is an agricultural stormwater&#13;
discharge, not subject to regulation.&#13;
70. 40 CFR § 412.4. The permit regulation, 40 CFR § 122.42,&#13;
