Many farmers in the United States rent part or even all of the land that they cultivate.1 In&#13;
1987, full tenants (who own no land) accounted for 11.5 percent of all farms in the United&#13;
States, and part owners (who farm both their own and rented land) accounted for another&#13;
29.2 percent. In terms of amount of farmland, full tenants cultivated 13.2 percent of U.S.&#13;
farmland, and part owners cultivated 53.9 percent2. Of the 282.2 million acres of&#13;
harvested cropland in the United States, 46.2 million acres were farmed by tenants and&#13;
168.7 million acres by part owners.3 Percent of full tenancy and part ownership varies&#13;
from state to state, but it is clear that a large proportion of U.S. agricultural land is farmed&#13;
by tenants.&#13;
U.S. lease law is rooted in medieval English common law.4 The lease is a conveyance&#13;
of an estate in land-a leasehold, or possessory, interest (rather than the freehold, or ownership,&#13;
interest). Thus, principles of real property law have helped to shape American&#13;
lease law. But a lease is also a contractual agreement; an express contract (the lease) normally&#13;
gives rise to the relationship between landlord and tenant. Accordingly, specialized&#13;
principles of contract law govern many aspects of the landlord-tenant relationship.&#13;
The agricultural landlord-tenant relationship involves a contract (written or oral) under&#13;
which the tenant enjoys possession and control of the owner's land in exchange for the&#13;
payment of rent. Many aspects of farm leases differ little from other types of leases, but&#13;
in some respects farm tenancies are unique. For example, rent may be expressed as a&#13;
share of the crop or livestock, instead of the cash payment typical of other leases. Because&#13;
landowner and farmer often know each other personally, the tenancy relationship may be&#13;
informal. Therefore, a surprisingly large number of farm leases are oral agreements&#13;
based on mutual trust.5&#13;
In comparison with regulation of farm leases in several European countries, regulation&#13;
of farm leases in the United States is relatively nonintrusive. Most legal principles that&#13;
govern leases are found in state law. Both common-law principles and statutes govern&#13;
leases, and numerous state court decisions help to develop the common law and to interpret relevant statutes. Many legal principles applied to ordinary commercial leases also&#13;
apply to agricultural leases, but some specialized farm lease law has developed. In most&#13;
states, agricultural leases are governed in part by common-law principles and statutes that&#13;
reflect the practical requirements (for example, the crop season) of the farm landlordtenant&#13;
relationship. Some of the specialized law is designed to protect the property rights&#13;
of landlord or tenant.&#13;
In effect, much of farm lease law is 'private law', that is, contractual law. Landowner&#13;
and farmer have the freedom to structure their relationship by contract, and the terms of&#13;
their contract will be respected and enforced, should litigation result. No government&#13;
agency supervises the process of lease formation, nor are the terms (for example, rent&#13;
amount or lease duration) of farm tenancy contracts normally subject to government supervision.&#13;
Serious disputes arising from farm leases are litigated like other cases in the&#13;
state court system.&#13;
This article discusses a number of principles that characterize U.S. farm lease law.&#13;
Lease formation issues focus on the type of rent payment, the distinctions between farm&#13;
tenancies and other landowner-farmer relationships, and the duration and termination of&#13;
leases. During the term of the leases, the rights and duties of landlord and tenant are&#13;
particularly important. Several legal principles, including the doctrine of emblements and&#13;
the landlord lien, are intended to protect the tenant's right to the crop and the landlord's&#13;
right to rent.</inleiding><content>LEASE FORMATION ISSUES&#13;
Rent under Farm Leases&#13;
Rent under farm leases is not prescribed by law or regulation; it is established by contract&#13;
between the parties. Most agricultural leases establish rent by one of three general methods:&#13;
crop-share, cash, or livestock-share6. The crop-share lease offers flexibility and is&#13;
used frequently. Under the typical crop-share lease, the landlord provides the land, part of&#13;
the equipment, and a share of the inputs (seed, fertilizer, and other chemicals) needed for&#13;
the farming operation. In exchange, the landlord receives a share (often the same as his&#13;
share of inputs) of the crops as rent. The landlord's share may range from one-third to&#13;
one-half, depending on the quality of the land, local custom, and the contributions of farmer&#13;
and landlord. Some crop-share leases also include provisions for supplemental cash&#13;
rent for use of the farmstead, buildings, or pasture and hay lands.&#13;
Under the cash lease, the farmer makes a cash payment (a specified sum per acre or a&#13;
more flexible amount determined by formula) for the use of farmland. The tenant normally&#13;
pays all farming expenses (but not taxes, insurance, and major repairs on buildings).&#13;
Under the typical livestock-share lease, landlord and tenant each own one-half of the livestock&#13;
and specialized equipment; they share the expenses of the operation and the livestock&#13;
and crop income.&#13;
Two other rental arrangements are used less often. A small percentage of farm leases&#13;
may be labor-share leases, under which the farmer normally contributes only labor and management. These are sometimes used when an owner wants to transfer responsibility&#13;
for farming but continue to supervise, for example, in a family preparing to transfer the&#13;
farm to the younger generation. With a net-share lease, the landlord receives cash rent&#13;
that is a function of annual yields and thus reflects the value of the land as a proportion of&#13;
the farm's crop production. The net-share lease minimizes the landowner's involvement&#13;
in the farm operation, yet allows the owner to profit from good yields or high crop prices.&#13;
Nature of the Relationship&#13;
Under legal principles in the United States, landowners and farmers are free to choose the&#13;
type of relationship that will govern the farming operation. Their contract can create a&#13;
landlord-tenant relationship, an employer-employee relationship, or a partnership.7 The&#13;
language of the written agreement will help to determine what type of relationship has&#13;
been created. Careful drafting, in light of state law, will ensure that the document carries&#13;
out the parties' intentions. Principles of lease law apply only to true leases.&#13;
When landowner and fanner enter a cash lease, it will be difficult to assert that the relationship&#13;
creates anything but a landlord-tenant relationship. In contrast, an agreement to&#13;
farm on shares may raise important questions of interpretation, especially if the contract&#13;
does not indicate clearly the nature of the relationship. An ambiguous agreement might&#13;
be interpreted as a crop-share lease, an employment (or cropper) contract, a tenancy in&#13;
common in the crops, or a partnership.&#13;
The difference between a crop-share lease and an employment contract is particularly&#13;
significant. Under the crop-share lease, the farmer has a possessory interest in the land&#13;
and a property right in the crops. Under the employment contract, the crop belongs to the&#13;
landowner; the farmer is an employee who has no interest in the land and who receives a&#13;
portion of the crops as wages8. The intention of the parties, as inferred from the language&#13;
of the document and the surrounding circumstances, is critical. When an agreement grants&#13;
the farmer exclusive possession of the land, the parties normally intend to create a landlord-&#13;
tenant relationship.9 When the agreement is oral and informal, it is often difficult to&#13;
determine the intention of the parties.&#13;
In a few states, an ambiguous agreement may create a tenancy in common in the crops&#13;
rather than a lease.10 The tenancy in common means that landowner and farmer are coowners&#13;
of the crop, normally from the time the crop begins to grow. Courts do not always&#13;
distinguish clearly between leaseholds and tenancies in common. In fact, several courts have held that every contract to farm on shares, whether a crop-share lease or a cropper&#13;
contract, creates a tenancy in common in the crops. This approach seems sensible because&#13;
it confirms the ownership interests of landlord and tenant and protects the landlord's&#13;
interest, particularly important when crops are claimed by creditors in or out of bankruptcy.&#13;
Even in the tenancy in common, however, the producer has the right to possession of&#13;
the crops until harvest11.&#13;
Some farming relationships involve partnerships rather than leases. A partnership is&#13;
'an association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit. 12'&#13;
A partnership may exist if the operation is conducted at the joint and equal expense of&#13;
the parties, with equal division of net proceeds. Livestock-share leases are particularly&#13;
subject to this interpretation, especially when landlord and tenant own half of the&#13;
livestock, split the cost of supplies, and receive half of the livestock and crop income.&#13;
Sharing profits of a business is normally evidence of partnership, but a partnership will not&#13;
usually result when a share of profits is received as payment of rent to a landlord.13 In&#13;
many livestock-share relationships, the parties will be able to establish that the&#13;
landowner's share is truly rent, especially when other factors point to existence of a&#13;
lease. The intention of the parties is usually controlling, and a court will examine all the&#13;
circumstances in characterizing the relationship.&#13;
Lease Duration and Termination&#13;
Duration&#13;
The duration of a farm lease in the United States is generally a contractual matter. In contrast&#13;
with the situation in the Netherlands under the Pachtwet, no minimum lease duration&#13;
is prescribed by law. Indeed, short-term leases, often for only one year, are common, particularly&#13;
for cropland. In practice, however, many tenants farm the same ground (for one&#13;
or more landlords) for a number of years under a series of one-year leases. The tenant has&#13;
no right to continue to farm the landlord's property beyond the term of the lease. Moreover,&#13;
no automatic right of renewal exists. Instead, the landlord has the right to possession&#13;
of the farmland at the end of the lease term, and if the tenant wrongfully remains in possession,&#13;
the landlord can invoke legal process (forcible entry and detainer) to remove the&#13;
tenant.&#13;
During the lease term, a question may arise about whether the tenant can assign the&#13;
lease to a different tenant. Landlords rely on the personal characteristics of their tenants,&#13;
and most written leases therefore prohibit the tenant from assigning the lease. Many court&#13;
decisions have held that a farm lease (especially a crop-share lease) is a personal service&#13;
contract that cannot be assigned.14&#13;
In a few states, statutory or constitutional provisions impose maximum limits, ranging&#13;
from 10 to 51 years, on the duration of agricultural lease terms.15 The rationale for these&#13;
provisions (at least during the mid-19th century) was the oppressive nature of long-term&#13;
leases, which deprive tenants of the incentive to improve land and the fair rewards for doing so.16 Probably because farm leases have rather short terms, these provisions have&#13;
rarely been interpreted. 17&#13;
When a landowner who has leased his land decides to sell the property, he has no obligation&#13;
to offer that land first to the tenant. If the property is sold, however, the buyer normally&#13;
takes the property subject to the lease. Unless the parties have agreed otherwise, the&#13;
tenant will have the right to remain on the land untill the end of the lease term.&#13;
Termination&#13;
The type of lease and the rules for termination are closely linked in U.S. farm lease law.&#13;
In most states, lease types include the tenancy for years (for a term certain), year-to-year&#13;
(periodic) tenancy, tenancy at will, and tenancy at sufferance. Farm tenancies may be terminated&#13;
by agreement of the parties. In the absence of agreement, common-law rules or&#13;
statutes prescribe the proper method for terminating leases. Some states (e.g., Kansas)&#13;
have rather complex termination statutes.&#13;
The tenancy for years, or for a term certain, is a contract in which the termination date&#13;
of the tenancy is fixed by the lease. Both tenant and landlord therefore know the date on&#13;
which the lease ends. Unless statutes or contract terms provide otherwise, a lease for&#13;
years ends on the stated termination date, and no additional notice is required from either&#13;
party. Most tenancies for years are established in written leases but, subject to the Statute&#13;
of Frauds, an oral lease with a definite termination date can also establish a tenancy for&#13;
years.&#13;
A year-to-year (periodic) lease is a tenancy that lasts for one year (in the farm context)&#13;
and continues for successive yearly periods unless it is terminated at the end of any&#13;
period by timely notice from either party. Year-to-year leases are often oral, but may also&#13;
be established in a written contract. These leases also result when a tenant holds over with&#13;
the landlord's consent after termination of a written lease for a term certain; the new lease&#13;
that results is a year-to-year lease.&#13;
Termination of a year-to-year lease is effective only if it is both timely and proper. In&#13;
many states, common-law rules or statutes determine how much notice is required to terminate&#13;
a year-to-year lease. The notice period in Illinois, for example, is four months; in&#13;
Missouri, sixty days. In addition, statutes often specify that notice must be written; sometimes&#13;
method of delivery of notice is prescribed. If a party fails to give effective notice of&#13;
termination, the farm lease will continue automatically for another one-year period.&#13;
The tenancy at will allows either landowner or tenant to terminate a lease at any time.&#13;
At common law, the tenancy at will could be terminated without prior notice. In several&#13;
states, however, laws require prior notice, ranging in length from ten days to three&#13;
months, to terminate the tenancy at will. Because of their uncertainty, farm tenancies at&#13;
will are rare.&#13;
The tenancy at sufferance arises briefly if a tenant holds over without the landlord's&#13;
consent. The landlord must act promptly to remove the holdover tenant from the land, or&#13;
the tenant will become a year-to-year tenant for a new periodic lease.&#13;
Many court cases involving leases focus on termination, especially in year-to-year&#13;
leases. Often the cases are brought by tenants who assert that notice of termination was&#13;
untimely or otherwise defective. When a landlord gives notice at the end of the lease term, there is generally no requirement that the landlord state any reason for the termination.&#13;
The landlord is free to terminate because he or a family member whishes to farm,&#13;
because he has found a new tenant, or for some other reason. A landowner who&#13;
participates in U.S. government farm programs faces some restrictions on lease termination.&#13;
Termination during the lease term is more difficult. If a party breaches a contractual&#13;
duty in the lease, the proper remedy at common law is a suit for damages, rather than&#13;
lease termination.18 In some jurisdictions, termination is now an appropriate remedy. In&#13;
addition, many leases specify termination as the remedy for certain breaches (for example,&#13;
failure to pay rent, commission of waste). Moreover, some court decisions have permitted&#13;
termination when the tenant failed to implement farming practices required in the&#13;
lease.19&#13;
DUTIES OF LANDLORD AND TENANT&#13;
A well-written farm lease will normally specify the rights and duties of landlord and tenant;&#13;
rights and duties are implied in an oral lease. The written lease will include provisions&#13;
about the payment of rent (cash or division of crops), the items provided by&#13;
landlord (land and buildings) and tenant (machinery and equipment), and their shares of&#13;
expenses (seed, fertilizer, transportation). The lease may specify the cropping system20&#13;
and delineate the extent to which the landlord will be involved in management decisions.&#13;
In practice, many farm landlords and tenants cooperate closely in making decisions about&#13;
both crop production and conservation practices. The extent of the landowner's involvement&#13;
in the farm operation may have significant income tax and estate tax consequences.&#13;
The tenant's care for the farmland is a central issue. Two interrelated obligations are&#13;
involved: good husbandry and avoidance of waste21. These obligations are normally an&#13;
implied part of every farm tenancy, even if the lease is oral or does not refer to these concepts.&#13;
Good husbandry means implementation of farming practices used by competent&#13;
farmers. If the lease does not define the husbandry required, the farmer will be required to&#13;
follow the customs and practices prevailing in the locale. Waste causes damage to the&#13;
land. Voluntary waste includes acts like removal of topsoil or unauthorized sale of trees;&#13;
permissive waste includes failing to make necessary repairs or remove weeds, or permitting&#13;
excessive erosion. Poor husbandry often results in waste. A well-drafted lease will&#13;
specify farming practices that the tenant must follow and actions that are prohibited.&#13;
If a landlord wants specific conservation practices used on his farm, those practices&#13;
may be required by lease. Landlord and tenant are free to negotiate the terms of their&#13;
lease. Under the tenancy system in the United States, where the landlord has freedom to&#13;
find a new tenant at the end of the (often one-year) lease term, the landlord's superior&#13;
bargaining power may induce the tenant to implement conservation measures. Enforcement&#13;
may be difficult, however, and conservation practices will be more successful when the tenant cooperates fully. The tenant who fails to carry out the required practices may&#13;
be liable to the landlord for damages or subject to termination. If required practices go&#13;
beyond the usual standards of good husbandry, a written lease is essential.22&#13;
The tenant has the duty to return the land to the owner in the condition in which he occupied&#13;
it (with allowance for normal use). The landlord generally has no duty to&#13;
reimburse the tenant for improvements made to the property or for the value of fertilizer&#13;
elements remaining in the ground. In some cases, certain fixtures (items of personal property&#13;
attached to real estate) can be removed by the tenant. Owner and farmer should&#13;
agree on payment for improvements before the projects are carried out. Written leases often&#13;
calculate reimbursement for remaining fertilizer.&#13;
PROTECTION FOR LANDLORD AND TENANT&#13;
The freedom of contract characteristic of U.S. farm lease law means that contract terms&#13;
can be negotiated to protect each party to the lease. When the parties do not negotiate&#13;
terms, or when the contract is oral and informal, rights and duties of landlord and tenant&#13;
are implied, as discussed above. In addition, statutes in many states offer specific protection&#13;
to landlord and tenant. The requirement of notice for termination of year-to-year&#13;
leases is an example of a statute that protects both landlord and tenant. The doctrine of&#13;
emblements and the landlord lien are others. Disputes connected with farm leases often&#13;
focus on issues of termination, including the tenant's right to the crop, or the landlord's&#13;
right to receive rent.&#13;
Emblements&#13;
The term of a farm lease is designed to give the tenant the chance to plant and harvest&#13;
crops during an appropriate growing season.23In midwestern states, for example, the typical&#13;
farm lease begins 1 March and ends 28 February of the following year; this permits&#13;
the tenant to plant and harvest many annual crops. Sometimes, however, the lease term&#13;
ends before a tenant's crop has been harvested. This may occur if the tenant's crop has an&#13;
atypical growing season (for example, winter wheat, planted in the fall and harvested the&#13;
following summer) or if the landlord is a life tenant who dies during the lease term.24&#13;
The doctrine of emblements may protect the tenant whose lease ends before the crops&#13;
have been harvested. When it applies, the doctrine provides that a tenant may reenter the land to harvest and remove crops that will mature after expiration of the lease.25 The doctrine&#13;
does not give the tenant a right to possession of the land, but only the right to ingress&#13;
and egress on the land for a reasonable time to harvest the crop. Moreover, it does not&#13;
compensate the tenant for preparation of the land without planting crops, though statutory&#13;
provisions or prior agreement with the landlord may protect the tenant.&#13;
Three general requirements must be met if the doctrine of emblements is to apply: the&#13;
crops must be a product of the tenant's labor (and not merely a product of nature); termination&#13;
of the tenancy must not be the tenant's fault; and the tenancy must be for an uncertain&#13;
term.&#13;
Not all types of crops are protected by the doctrine of emblements. At common law,&#13;
crops are classified as fructus naturales or fructus industriales. Fructus naturales refers to&#13;
crops with perennial roots; these include hay, clover, and fruit from trees. Fructus industriales&#13;
refers to crops with annual roots; these are products like corn, oats, and wheat,&#13;
which are produced by the farmer's labor. The common-law doctrine of emblements applied&#13;
only to fructus industriales. One late nineteenth-century court decision, for example,&#13;
refused to apply the doctrine to blackberries because the blackberry bushes were&#13;
permanent improvements to the land, and any one year's crop did not depend on labor&#13;
performed that year.26&#13;
In recent years, courts have been more willing to award emblements for crops that require&#13;
annual care and cultivation to increase the quantity and improve the quality of the&#13;
product. Accordingly, a number of court decisions have treated perennial crops - for&#13;
example, orchard fruits (oranges and apples), pecans, grass, hay, and clover - as emblements.&#13;
Though the rigid fructus naturales-fructus industriales distinction no longer applies&#13;
in every jurisdiction, reasoned decisions require annual labor from the tenant who&#13;
claims emblements.&#13;
When termination of the tenancy is the fault of the tenant, that tenant has no right to&#13;
emblements. The tenant may be at fault, for example, through breach of the lease contract&#13;
or voluntary surrender of the leasehold. A common breach is the tenant's failure to pay&#13;
rent; if that breach results in forfeiture of the tenancy, the tenant's right to the crop ends.&#13;
Voluntary surrender of the tenancy also defeats the tenant's claim to emblements.&#13;
In emblements cases, the type of crop and the reason for termination tend to pose few&#13;
problems. The third requirement, that the lease term be uncertain, is often the focus of&#13;
analysis. This is appropriate, because uncertainty of the lease term is the basis for the&#13;
equitable and economic rationales behind the doctrine. That is, the doctrine developed&#13;
both to encourage agriculture as a matter of public policy and to ensure that tenants who&#13;
reasonably spent money and effort on the landlord's property were compensated. The tenant&#13;
whose term is uncertain will be reluctant to plant without the assurance that he will be&#13;
compensated even if the lease term ends unexpectedly.&#13;
In practice, it is clear that a tenant under a lease for a term of years (for a term certain)&#13;
will not receive emblements. The tenant for years should not plant crops that will mature&#13;
after the lease terminates. The landlord expects to receive possession of the land without&#13;
encumbrances at conclusion of the lease term. In contrast, some lease terms are clearly&#13;
uncertain for purposes of emblements. The tenancy at will (when the landlord terminates) is uncertain, and the doctrine of emblements&#13;
will apply, either by common law or by statute. Also, the farming tenant who rents&#13;
from a life tenant has an uncertain term, and if the life tenant dies (thus terminating the&#13;
lease), the farming tenant will have the right to emblements. In a few states, a statute extends&#13;
the undertenant's estate to the end of the lease year in this situation, and the doctrine&#13;
of emblements need not take effect.&#13;
When the lease is a year-to-year lease, which continues for another year absent proper&#13;
notice to terminate, the question of uncertainty is more complicated. Some of the more recent&#13;
court decisions make a distinction based on the planting situation at the time of&#13;
notice. These decisions reach results that are fair to both landlord and tenant. The year-toyear&#13;
tenant who receives notice before sowing a crop will not receive emblements (i.e.,&#13;
the tenancy will be considered certain). The tenant who receives notice after sowing will&#13;
be eligible to reenter the land to harvest the crop {i.e., the tenancy will be considered uncertain).&#13;
This distinction has also been established by state statute (e.g., Colorado).&#13;
The doctrine of emblements involves a complicated combination of policy, common&#13;
law, and state statute. Even when a tenant fails to qualify for the doctrine, he may be successful&#13;
in invoking other legal theories in an attempt to harvest the crop he planted before&#13;
the lease terminated. 27&#13;
The Landlord Lien&#13;
Rent is the landlord's payment for his contribution to the farming operation. If a tenant&#13;
faces financial difficulty (or simply fails to pay), the landlord's rent may be at risk. Therefore,&#13;
most states protect the farm landlord with a lien on the tenant's crops for rent and&#13;
advances. Though the provisions of these state liens vary, the Illinois statute is typical:&#13;
Every landlord shall have a lien upon the crops grown or growing upon the demised&#13;
premises for the rent thereof, whether the same is payable wholly or in part in money or&#13;
specific articles of property or products of the premises, or labor, and also for the faithful&#13;
performance of the terms of the lease.28&#13;
The lien attaches when the crops begin to grow and continues for six months after expiration&#13;
of the lease term. Good faith purchasers take crops free of the landlord's lien in&#13;
Illinois, unless the landlord gives written notice to potential buyers under the terms of the&#13;
statute. The tenant must disclose the names of intended buyers.&#13;
If the tenant enters bankruptcy29, the court must determine the rights of both landlord&#13;
and tenant in crops and livestock raised under the lease30. Unfortunately, the state landlord&#13;
lien will not protect the landlord when the tenant enters bankruptcy. Under the federal&#13;
Bankruptcy Code (§ 545), statutory liens for rent and liens of distress for rent can be&#13;
avoided, and the landlord will lose this important protection. Some landowners try to protect themselves by taking a consensual lien - that is, a security&#13;
interest - in the crops, either in the lease itself or (better) in a separate security&#13;
agreement. When properly created and perfected pursuant to Article 9 of the Uniform&#13;
Commercial Code, the security interest can provide more reliable protection than the&#13;
landlord lien. It is essential that the security interest be perfected properly (normally by&#13;
filling a financing statement); unperfected security interests may also be defeated in bankruptcy&#13;
(Bankruptcy Code § 544). Issues of priority between claimants to the same&#13;
collateral may still exist and will be resolved through application of Article 9 principles31.&#13;
The landlord, like other secured creditors, must also comply with the notice requirements&#13;
of the federal farm products rule, if the security interest is to be enforced against a purchaser&#13;
of the tenant's crop.32&#13;
In many states, the unpaid landlord has another statutory remedy, distress for rent.33&#13;
Under this process, the landlord has the right to seize for rent personal property of the tenant&#13;
located in the county where the tenant resides. Normally a court proceeding is involved,&#13;
and the landlord must follow statutory requirements closely.&#13;
CONCLUSION&#13;
Farm tenancy is an important component of agricultural structure in the United States.&#13;
Despite the extent of tenancy in American agriculture, the landlord-tenancy relationship&#13;
has not been heavily regulated. In fact, freedom of contract has been an important hallmark&#13;
of farm leasing law in the United States. Principles of contract law govern many&#13;
aspects of farm tenancy relationships, and specialized statutes and common-law rules protect&#13;
particularly significant interests. For example, the doctrine of emblements protects&#13;
the tenant's interest in the crop, and the landlord lien helps to ensure that the rent is paid.&#13;
The requirement of timely notice for termination of year-to-year leases helps both landlord&#13;
and tenant to plan for the following year.&#13;
Admittedly, farm leasing law in the United States does not protect every interest perfectly.&#13;
For example, though a farm tenant may enjoy a long-term relationship with a landlord,&#13;
no law ensures security of tenure for the farm tenant. Nor are leasing practices&#13;
always perfectly adapted to long-term conservation goals. The short-term leases that are&#13;
commonly used, for example, may not foster optimum stewardship of agricultural land.&#13;
Some tenants may farm for maximum productivity and immediate income, rather than for&#13;
sustained productivity. Landlords and tenants, however, have the opportunity to structure&#13;
their contractual agreement to protect the interests central to their relationship.&#13;
As the discussion in this article has indicated, the approach to agricultural tenancy in&#13;
the United States contrasts with the more stringent regulation in the Netherlands and&#13;
some other European nations. Farm lease law in the United States combines a scheme of&#13;
regulation to protect significant interests with freedom of contract and flexibility in landuse&#13;
decisionmaking for both landlord and tenant.</content><legacyfootnotes>1. Parts of this article have been adapted from Margaret Rosso Grossman, Agricultural Leases: Some Issues&#13;

5. The Statute of Frauds (a principle that requires some types of contracts to be written if they are to be&#13;
enforced) may prevent enforcement of an oral lease that cannot be performed within one year.&#13;
Nonetheless, oral farm leases are common.&#13;

Agriculture, Cooperative Extension Service, Circular 1199,1982).&#13;
7. Other possibilities are license (permissive use of realty that does not create an estate in land) or joint&#13;
venture (similar to a partnership, but involving a single business enterprise). The relationship may also&#13;
involve a bailment (a delivery of personal property in trust for a particular purpose). On these&#13;
relationships, see Philip E. Harris &amp; Alan C. Schroeder, 'Farm Leases', Chapter 121 in Neil E. Had,&#13;
Agricultural Law (1985).&#13;

9. Absent exclusive possession, other contract provisions can point toward a lease: a fixed term, surrender of&#13;
possession at the end of the term, prohibition against subletting, a requirement for the farmer to repair&#13;
improvements, the farmer's right to divide the crop, and the farmer's freedom to control his own activity.&#13;
Different provisions suggest a cropper contract: the landowner's retained possession of the land and title&#13;
to the crop, the owner's control over the farmer's activity, and the owner's duty to supply most or all of&#13;
the farm inputs. Margaret Rosso Grossman &amp; Thomas G. Fischer, The Farm Lease in Bankruptcy: A&#13;

15. See Harris &amp; Schroeder, supra note 7, p. 121-72 to -73. A few states limit all (or city lot) leases to&#13;
maximum terms of 75 (Montana) or 99 (Alabama, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota) years. Id.&#13;
16. Casey v. Lupkes, 286 N.W.2d 204 (Iowa 1979).&#13;
17. The Iowa Constitutional provision, valid since 1857, was interpreted by the Supreme Court of Iowa only&#13;
in 1979. Id.&#13;
18. See Harris &amp; Schroeder, supra note 7, p. 121 -80 to -81. If a condition of a lease (instead of a covenant)&#13;
is breached, the remedy is termination. It is sometimes difficult to determine whether a provision is a&#13;
covenant or a condition.&#13;
19. E.g., McElwee v. DeVault, 120 N.W.2d 451 (Iowa 1963) (termination after first year of three-year lease).&#13;
20. Unless the lease specifies otherwise, the tenant normally manages the rented property and determines the&#13;
cropping system.&#13;
21. See Harris &amp; Schroeder, supra note 7, p. 121-138 to -146.&#13;
22. On these issues, see generally Neil D. Hamilton, Adjusting Farm Tenancy Practices to Support&#13;
Sustainable Agriculture, 12 Journal of Agricultural Taxation &amp; Law 226 (1990).&#13;
23. The discussion of emblements is drawn from an extensive analysis in Margaret Rosso Grossman &amp;&#13;
Matthew D. Tanner, The Farm Tenant's Right to the Away-Going Crop: A Review of the Doctrine of&#13;
Emblements, 12 Journal of Agricultural Taxation &amp; Law 195 (1990).&#13;
24. The life tenant occupies property pursuant to a life estate: an estate in land whose duration is measured by&#13;
the life of the life tenant (or some other person). The life estate terminates automatically when the&#13;
measuring life ends. Because an owner of real property can convey no greater estate than he possesses, a&#13;
lessee who leases from a life tenant loses claim to possession of the land when the life tenancy terminates&#13;
(that is, when the measuring life ends). This result may be altered if the remaindermen (those who will&#13;
own the property after the death of the life tenant) are parties to the lease or agree to continue the lease&#13;
after the life tenant's death. Some states have statutes that allow the tenant to stay on the land until the end&#13;
of the lease year. See, e.g., Ga. Code Ann. § 44-6-86 (Michie 1981).&#13;
25. The doctrine is one of the exceptions to the old general principle that the tenant must remove fixtures and&#13;
anything he puts on the land before the lease term expires; thereafter, the property belongs to the&#13;
landowner.&#13;
26. Sparrow v. Pond, 52 N.W. 36 (Minn. 1892).&#13;
27. These include unjust enrichment, contract (express or implied), custom, or estoppel. See Grossman &amp;&#13;
Tanner, supra note 23, p. 213-218, for further discussion of these theories.&#13;
28. 111. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, § 9-316 (1989). See also id. § 9-316.1.&#13;
29. For a discussion of farm bankruptcy in the U.S., see Margaret Rosso Grossman, Bankruptcy for the&#13;
family farmer in the United States, 49 Agr R 9 (1989).&#13;
30. The issues connected with bankruptcy are numerous and complicated; among these are the status of the&#13;
landlord lien, the ownership of crops and livestock produced under the lease, the right of the debtor to&#13;
assume or reject an unexpired lease, and damages for breach of contract terms. These issues are discussed&#13;
in detail in Grossman &amp; Fischer, supra note 9.&#13;
31. For a discussion of these issues, see Keith G. Meyer, Should the Unique Treatment of Agricultural Liens&#13;
Continue?, 24 Indiana Law Review 1315 (1991).&#13;
32. Id. There is now a nationwide effort to study agricultural liens (including the landlord lien) and to&#13;
determine how those liens might be coordinated with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.&#13;
Revision of Article 9 itself is also being considered. Statutory changes are possible within the next few&#13;
years.&#13;
