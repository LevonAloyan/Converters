As agriculture continues to adjust to consumer and political demands for foodstuffs in the twenty-first century, govern­ments alter laws and regulations in efforts to meet societal objectives. To review the noteworthy developments affect­ing rural America during the last two years, this paper is di­vided into three sections. The first section addresses issues regarding agricultural production and land use. Turning to environmental and social issues in the second section, the identification of several issues shows environmental quali­ty may be receiving less attention but the public is express­ing greater support for animal welfare. The third section ad­dresses nutrition and food law to highlight the increased interest in food safety.&#13;
</inleiding><content>2 Agricultural Production and Land Use&#13;
While strong prices for food products have helped the American agricultural sector through the country’s difficult economic times, four separate developments concerning ag­ricultural production and land use may be noted to identify changing conditions. The use of corn and soybeans for bio­energy production has contributed to a positive farm econ­omy. With respect to the use of wind for energy, impedi­ments and local resistance have thwarted the widespread use of this potential energy source. A judicial ruling on paying for the destruction of property under a disease eradication program may hamper governmental disease control efforts. Public support for locally grown agricultural products im­plies widespread interest in reducing greenhouse gases but there is no distinctive documentation indicating local pro­ducers actually use less energy.&#13;
A. Producing Biofuels for Energy&#13;
In the wake of concern about dependency on foreign oil, the U.S. Congress acted to encourage the production of biofu­els, leading to robust prices for corn, soybeans, and other farm commodities. With profits from grain production, some farmers are investing in crop land, and agricultural land prices in the Northern Plains and Corn Belt regions have in­creased significantly.1 The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 provided the first federal mandate that liquid biofuels be purchased by motorists.2 Section 211 of the Clean Air Act called for four billion gallons of renewable fuel to be used in gasoline in 2006 and the amount required was to increase in steps each year until 2022.3 With refinements to federal reg­ulations, encouragement is being given to biofuels that re­place gasoline and diesel fuels to prevent the release of car­bon stored over geologic time periods.&#13;
Renewable fuels are divided into ‘additional renewable fu­els’ and ‘advanced biofuels.’ Additional renewable fuels are those produced from renewable biomass. Advanced biofuels are those that have at least 50 percent less than baseline life­cycle greenhouse gas emissions defined as&#13;
the aggregate quantity of greenhouse gas emissions (including direct emissions and significant indirect emissions such as significant emissions from land use changes) … related to the full fuel lifecycle, includ­ing all stages of fuel and feedstock production and distribution, from feedstock generation or extraction through the distribution and delivery and use of the finished fuel to the ultimate consumer, where the mass values for all greenhouse gases are adjusted to account for their relative global warming potential.4&#13;
Advanced biofuels may include:&#13;
(I) Ethanol derived from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin.(II) Ethanol derived from sugar or starch (other than corn starch).(III) Ethanol derived from waste material, including crop residue, other vegetative waste material, animal waste, and food waste and yard waste.(IV) Biomass-based diesel.(V) Biogas (including landfill gas and sewage waste treatment gas) produced through the conversion of organic matter from renewable biomass.(VI) Butanol or other alcohols produced through the conversion of organic matter from renewable biomass.(VII) Other fuel derived from cellulosic biomass.5&#13;
This means that the legislation for biofuels is differentiat­ing between biofuels to offer more support for those that do &#13;
more for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The regula­tions set forth requirements for the Environmental Protec­tion Agency (hereafter: EPA) to administer a renewable fuel program with distinct production volumes for additional re­newable fuel and advanced biofuel. There are changing pro­visions that provide tax credits, favorable loans, and subsidy programs concerning the encouragement of the production and refining of biofuel. Independent studies suggest that for the 2006 tax year, American subsidies for biofuels amounted to $6.3 to $8.6 billion.6&#13;
B. Developing Electricity from Wind&#13;
To harness more renewable energy, individuals and busi­nesses are turning to the wind. Many areas of the United States have considerable wind energy that can be harnessed to generate electricity. Yet, the development of this ener­gy source may be accompanied by environmental degrada­tion and other problems. 7Concerns about birds and nuisanc­es have caused persons to oppose the development of wind farms.8&#13;
State legislatures have responded with provisions to regu­late the development of electric-generating wind farms. Illi­nois decided that counties and municipalities should be able to establish standards and regulate the siting of devices and farms.9 However, prior to approval, the government needs to hold a public hearing. Ohio has more detailed provisions and requires that a proposed wind farm be economically sig­nificant with approval from a state power siting board.10 State provisions may also set noise levels11, attempt to de­termine what are unreasonable limitations12, address off­shore projects and habitat damage13, or preempt local gov­ernments from unreasonably limiting their development.14 Thus, states and communities are actively engaged in decid­ing how to regulate problems associated with the develop­ment of wind power resources.&#13;
C. Controlling the Disease Citrus Canker&#13;
Recent efforts by the state of Florida to eradicate the dis­ease citrus canker raise the issue of whether a government can destroy property in exposure zones to control a dis­ease under its police power or whether such action effects a compensable ‘taking’ under constitutional law.15 The Flor­ida legislature had declared citrus canker a public nuisance and the state had adopted a citrus canker eradication pro­gram under which trees near a known infestation were de­stroyed.16 Homeowners of destroyed citrus trees initiated a lawsuit for damages claiming the state should pay for the trees destroyed as required by the takings clause of the Flor­ida Constitution.17 The trial and appellate courts refused to recognize that citrus canker was a public nuisance and de­clined to follow federal jurisprudence concerning the dif­ferentiation of per se and regulatory takings.18 Instead, the appellate court decided that if Florida wanted to eradicate citrus canker, it should pay for property destroyed in expo­sure zones.&#13;
The citrus canker case raises a number of questions about what other governmental actions regulating disease, pre­scribing land use activities, precluding nuisances, and pro­tecting people from dangers might come under scrutiny and require compensation. Under American jurisprudence, while property owners have implied obligations not to use proper­ty in a manner injurious to the community, federal and state constitutions require governments to pay for property taken for public use.19 In efforts to control a disease, should gov­ernments be able to exercise their police power to destroy property exposed to the disease without compensation or should the government pay for the property taken? Given re­cent occurrences of citrus greening, mad cow disease, avian influenza, H1N1 (swine) flu, E. coli, and salmonella enterit­idis, governments and courts will receive requests for com­pensation from persons and businesses that are adversely af­fected by actions to control diseases.&#13;
While the citrus canker decision may herald a change in the balance between private property rights and exercises of the police power, it may not be a positive development. By granting greater compensation to property owners damaged by disease-control efforts, the decision introduces a moral hazard problem.20 With an implicit insurance policy, produc­ers lack incentives to invest in disease-prevention measures. Absent disease prevention, more diseases will become es­tablished and disease costs will increase. This will result in more expensive agricultural production.&#13;
D. Locavore Movement&#13;
A movement to eat local foods has gained momentum over the past several years in the United States. Many consumers object to the globalization, industrialization, and standard­ization of what they are eating. Consumers enjoy feeling that they are in tune with nature when they consume pro­duce that is in season, and that by purchasing food products from local farmers they can form personal relationships. The locavore movement also assumes that local foods use less energy and thereby is beneficial for the environment. Loca­vores support local economies, are able to eat produce that may be of higher quality, and claim food has a better taste. Local food is thought of as safer from tampering by bioter­rorism and contamination.&#13;
A major justification for the locavore movement involves ‘food miles,’ the distance from where food is produced to where it is consumed. Many food products involve consid­erable transport that creates an environmental burden in the form of air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions and a so­cial burden in noise, accidents, and traffic congestion. But, the calculation of food miles generally only measures the distance the food has traveled from production to retailers which means it neglects energy costs employed in its pro­duction. Food miles do not consider what type of transpor­tation was chosen or what type of fuel it uses. Often, data on food miles fail to sort out the vessel’s carbon emissions per unit of food, so that comparisons cannot evaluate the carbon emission per unit of produce.&#13;
Food miles also may not consider the distance that the con­sumer drives to purchase their locally grown food. Finally, the cost of storing food locally until it is consumed cannot be ignored. When the cost of storage is included, local pro­ducers may consume more energy and be the source of high­er carbon dioxide emissions than imported products, even after transportation. Transportation has been estimated to make up only 11 percent of food’s life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, and only 4 percent of emissions arise from de­livery from the producer to the retailer.21 These low energy levels mean that other costs and expenses may alter the re­sult of which food involves fewer carbon costs.&#13;
Researchers in New Zealand have conducted several case studies that explore the potential problems with using food miles to judge the environmental impact of food.22 New Zealand can show that when all of the energy and carbon emissions of production are considered, their products are the better choice in the United Kingdom than many local products. New Zealand farmers may use one-third the en­ergy to produce apples in New Zealand than farmers in the United Kingdom. Turning to dairy solids, year-round graz­ing allows New Zealand farmers to use one-half the ener­gy to produce dairy solids that are sold in the United King­dom. It takes one-fourth the energy to produce lamb in New Zealand and export it as opposed to raising lamb in the Unit­ed Kingdom. From an international perspective, a locavore movement makes it difficult for developing countries to im­prove their conditions by exporting food.23 Promoting local food in ways that discriminate against products from other markets may be contrary to international trade law.&#13;
Accompanying the locavore movement in the United States is a desire by some Americans to become more active in producing their food in their urban settings.24 While gar­dening is generally acceptable under municipal zoning ordi­nances, raising farm animals is not. Therefore, communities have faced homeowner challenges to municipal ordinanc­es that preclude homeowners from raising animals, especial­ly poultry. A movement touting home-grown eggs has taken off, and many homeowners are making a space for chick­ens in their back yards.25 Most cities have had zoning ordi­nances that preclude raising chickens, unless the homeown­er has property of a certain size. With an increased citizen desire to raise chickens, governments are allowing property owners with sufficient area to raise chickens.26 For example, a metro-Atlanta county adopted a proposal to allow property owners with at least one-half acre to raise chickens.27 How­ever, others are concerned what backyard chicken produc­tion may mean with respect to disease control and the dis­posal of dead birds.&#13;
3 Environmental and Social Issues&#13;
Numerous issues regarding the environment continue to af­fect agricultural production and rural America. In a move­ment championed by business interests, Congress is being asked to change federal law concerning the classification of greenhouse gases as a pollutant. Concerns about pollution from animal production continue to present courts and regu­lators with questions concerning the validity of water qual­ity regulations applicable to concentrated animal feeding operations. Another water quality issue involves a propos­al for new legislation under which agricultural uses of pesti­cides would not require a permit under the Clean Water Act. A request to market a genetically-modified fish poses an en­vironmental issue that seeks legislative approval. The final two developments involve individual U.S. state legislation requiring more space for food animals being reared in con­fined areas and husbandry issues involving animal welfare.&#13;
A. Regulating Greenhouse Gases&#13;
A major environmental issue is whether greenhouse gases (hereafter: GHGs) can be regulated by EPA under the Clean Air Act. Due to costs of pollution from motor vehicle emis­sions, Massachusetts and other states sued EPA in 2007 to classify carbon dioxide (CO2) as an air pollutant.28 Massachusetts was successful and the U.S. Supreme Court found that greenhouse gases (GHGs) were pollutants under the Clean Air Act. EPA therefore has the statutory authority to regulate GHGs from new motor vehicles. In a separate ac­tion, California petitioned EPA for a waiver from section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act so that the state could regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles. California wanted to require reductions in fleet-average greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous ox­ide, and hydrofluorocarbons for most new passenger motor vehicles sold in California, beginning with the 2009 mod­el year. The Bush administration denied California’s waiv­er petition in 2008, but it was reversed under the Obama ad­ministration in 2009.&#13;
In September 2009, EPA, along with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, proposed joint rulemaking on new vehicle GHG and fuel economy standards.29 As part of that rulemaking effort, the Obama administration secured memoranda of understanding from California and automak­ers that federal standards be harmonized – to the extent pos­sible – with California standards, and that California accept certain stipulations. On April 1, 2010, the federal govern­ment finalized the new regulations that apply to vehicle-model years 2012-2016. The determination that GHGs from automobiles endanger public health and welfare will affect regulations on other sectors. If motor vehicle carbon dioxide emissions are harmful, similar emissions from other sourc­es (e.g., power plants) are also harmful.30 Therefore, EPA is moving forward with regulations for large, stationary sourc­es as well as further emissions standards for automobiles and heavy trucks, and on mandatory emissions monitoring for various sectors.&#13;
However, Congress may not view these developments as an acceptable interpretation of the Clean Air Act. Several bills have been introduced in Congress, including the ‘Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011,’ to amend the Clean Air Act to prohibit EPA from regulating GHGs.31&#13;
B. Discharge Permits for CAFOs&#13;
Concentrated animal feeding operations (hereafter: CAFOs), sometimes referred to as ‘factory farms,’ remain contro­versial, and so do the efforts by EPA to regulate the largest of these businesses under the Clean Water Act. In address­ing the issues of discharges into waters that require Nation­al Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits under the Clean Water Act, EPA revised its CAFO Rule in 2008. Three of the provisions of this Rule were challenged by agricultur­al groups in National Pork Producers Council v. Environ­mental Protection Agency.32 First, petitioners argued that the ‘duty to apply’ requirement exceeded EPA’s authority to reg­ulate CAFO discharges. The second challenge was that EPA could not hold persons liable for failing to secure a permit. Third, the petitioners argued that EPA could not regulate the land application of manure.&#13;
The petitioners were successful with their first two argu­ments. Following an earlier ruling in Waterkeeper Alli­ance Inc. v. Environmental Protection Agency33, the Nation­al Pork Producers Council court found that the Clean Water Act only regulates actual discharges. EPA’s regulation of persons who propose to discharge was ultra vires so could not be upheld. However, fourteen days later a Michigan state court held that under Michigan law, CAFOs without discharges may be required to secure discharge permits.34 To prevent water pollution, states can have more stringent re­quirements than exist under the federal Clean Water Act.&#13;
The National Pork Producers court also agreed with pe­titioners that EPA lacked authority to impose liability for failing to apply for a permit. The penalty provisions of the Clean Water Act delineate the actions that can be taken for violations involving discharges, and these do not include lia­bility for failing to apply for a permit.35&#13;
Concerning the third argument of the regulation of the land application of manure, the National Pork Producers Council court found that the appeal was time barred. The court not­ed that the Waterkeeper court had concluded that the Clean Water Act’s definition of ‘effluent limitations’ encompassed nutrient management plans and that a CAFO’s site-specif­ic nutrient management plan needed to be incorporated in its permit. Thus, the regulation of land application areas has been recognized as possible.&#13;
C. Amending Pesticide Regulations&#13;
The U.S. Congress is considering a bill (H.R. 872) that would amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Ro­denticide Act.36 The legislation would amend the Act so that pesticide residues from authorized uses of pesticides enter­ing water do not require a discharge permit. Farmers support the proposal so that they do not incur liability for violating the Clean Water Act. The bill is opposed by environmental groups who are concerned about pesticides contaminating water supplies.&#13;
D. Genetically Engineered Atlantic Salmon&#13;
In 2010, the Food and Drug Administration (hereafter: FDA) released a Briefing Packet from its Veterinary Medi­cine Advisory Committee on AquAdvantage Salmon, a ge­netically engineered Atlantic salmon intended to be used for food.37 These salmon are expected to grow faster than con­ventionally bred Atlantic Salmon. Because they are geneti­cally modified, FDA held public hearings and needs to de­termine labeling requirements. However, in March 2011, &#13;
federal lawmakers expressed concern about the approval of genetically engineered fish and may take congressional ac­tion to change the law.38 Environmental and food safety groups oppose approving the genetically engineered salm­on due to the lack of adequate proof that it will not adverse­ly affect wild salmon.39&#13;
E. Limitations on Animal Confinement Space&#13;
During the past decade, ethical considerations have led sev­eral states in the United States to enact legislation concern­ing animal confinement that makes animal production more expensive.40 Florida had an initiative concerning sow gesta­tion cages41, and several years later California voters rede­fined acceptable dimensions for cages housing sows, chick­ens, and veal calves.42 More significant, the confinement limitations have led the industry to voluntarily make ad­justments to animal production practices. Firms are alter­ing their standards for confinement regardless of limitations placed on them by state action. Smithfield Foods, Inc. and Cargill, two large pork producers, have phased out pig ges­tation crates.43 New hog operations employ group sow hous­ing. On the veal side of the industry, large producers are tak­ing similar action. They are converting their operations to group housing systems. In April 2011, the Ohio Livestock Care Standards Board voted to adopt a standard that phas­es out individual veal crates that prevent calves from turning around.44 The United Egg Producers and the Humane Soci­ety of the United States have reached an agreement on delin­eating standards regarding space for egg-laying chickens.45&#13;
The new animal confinement requirements suggest that the efficient and cheap production of animal food products may not be preferred by many citizens. Consumers, voters, and legislators have ethical concerns about the humane treat­ment of food animals and may exercise their choices in a number of venues. One is at the ballot box in adopting refer­enda and electing state legislators to institute changes in the treatment of animals. Another is shopping for food products identified with quality attributes concerning production.&#13;
F. Limiting Animal Husbandry Practices&#13;
Another development in the United States is whether animal producers should use husbandry practices that cause pain to their animals. Three animal husbandry practices are contro­versial due to the public’s feeling that they cause animals to suffer: tail docking, castration without an anesthetic agent, and beak trimming of poultry. Individual U.S. state legisla­tures are considering legislation to limit their use.&#13;
Tail docking is the partial amputation of a dairy cow’s tail in order to improve udder health and cow hygiene by pre­venting the tail becoming soiled by manure. It is common in some areas and legal in all but one state: California.46 Since California is the nation’s top-producing dairy state, the ad­opted legislation prohibiting tail docking of cattle and hors­es is expected to be a topic considered by other state legisla­tures in the future.&#13;
A second animal management practice is castration of male cattle and swine to control aggression and enhance weight gain.47 To reduce pain experienced by animals, many rec­ommend the use of an anesthetic agent. Another consider­ation is the minimization of physiologic stress during this procedure. Anesthetic agents have been studied extensively and there has not been a clear conclusion as to their useful­ness. While they can minimize or even eliminate pain, their use increases animal handling times and the stress related to the procedure. With respect to bulls, anesthetics have been shown to reduce acute pain but are less effective at alleviat­ing the overall stress responses measured by plasma cortisol levels.48 It is suggested that cattle be castrated at a young­er age because it has been shown that younger cattle exhibit less pain, stress, and distress in response to castration.49 Us­ing anesthetic agents increases farmers’ costs which may in­crease overall meat prices in grocery stores.&#13;
A third practice is beak trimming of poultry to prevent wast­ing feed and reduce excessive pecking and cannibalism. Be­havioral studies on beak trimming have shown that this practice is effective in reducing mortality rates and feed us­age of chickens housed in cages.50 However, ‘scientific evi­dence has shown that acute and long-term pain is associated with the procedure.’51 Also, beak trimming results in some permanent loss of sensory input to the bird and can result in extreme feed reduction that can comprise the overall well-being of the animal.52&#13;
­4 Nutrition and Food Law&#13;
In January 2011, the United States adopted the Food Safety Modernization Act that updated numerous food safety pro­visions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.53 This new legislation requires the secretary of the Food and Drug Administration to develop ‘science-based minimum stan­dards for conducting a hazard analysis, documenting haz­ards, implementing preventive controls, and documenting the implementation of the preventive controls.’54 Persons and firms dealing with foods need to identify and evaluate known or reasonably foreseeable hazards that may be asso­ciated with their facility. FDA is required to identify high-risk facilities, including foreign facilities, and allocate in­spection resources to inspect such facilities. Moreover, the new legislation encourages FDA to establish a program to provide for the expedited review and importation of food from importers. FDA was also granted authority to work with firms to cease distribution and to order recalls of food items that are adulterated or misbranded.&#13;
Governments and courts continue to make changes to rules that provide safe and wholesome food. FDA has revised its Reportable Food Registry for Industry for reporting situa­tions where there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences.55 This allows FDA to do a better job in tracking patterns and targeting inspections, and for the government to take action to remove items from the marketplace.&#13;
Three additional issues affecting nutrition and food law that are important for agriculture are petitions to state govern­ments to allow the sale of raw milk, federal regulations re­quiring information on calories in restaurant and vending machine foods, and a change in labeling milk products con­cerning recombinant bovine somatotropin.&#13;
A. Raw Milk&#13;
Due to illnesses in the early 1900s when raw milk was a major source of human disease, the U.S. Congress enact­ed a Pasteurized Milk Ordinance.56 However, in the last few years, a movement to allow people to purchase raw milk has created a debate about health issues involving dairy prod­ucts. People claim that raw milk tastes better and is more healthy.57 In 2011, marshals from FDA seized approximate­ly 80,000 pounds of cheese made from raw milk in Califor­nia.58 Evidence suggested that cheese from the facility was linked to an E. coli outbreak in 2010. In an earlier 2010 Cal­ifornia lawsuit, the federal government had enjoined an or­ganic dairy company from labeling, selling, and distribut­ing raw milk and raw milk products due to violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.59 The defendants had illegally marketed raw milk across state lines and had made health claims in violation of labeling requirements.&#13;
Although the pasteurization of milk slightly reduces the nu­tritional value of milk and diminishes a few of the vita­mins found in milk (thiamine, vitamin B12, and vitamin C), the basis for pasteurization is to kill harmful bacteria that cause tuberculosis, diphtheria, severe streptococcal infec­tions, typhoid fever, and other food-borne illnesses. Among dairy product-associated outbreaks reported to the U.S. Cen­ters for Disease Control (hereafter: CDC) between 1973 and 2008 in which the investigators reported whether the prod­uct was pasteurized or raw, 82 percent were due to raw milk or cheese.60 For a ten-year period ending in 2008, 86 out­breaks due to consumption of raw milk or raw milk products were reported to CDC. These resulted in 1,676 illnesses, 191 hospitalizations, and two deaths. Most of these illness­es were caused by Brucella, Campylobacter, Listeria, or Salmonella. For every outbreak and every illness reported, many others occur, and most illnesses are not part of recog­nized outbreaks. Despite these documented problems, peo­ple continue to petition state legislatures to allow the sale of raw milk. Legislatures are deciding that personal choice to buy raw milk is more important than food safety concerns.&#13;
B. Restaurant Labeling for Calories&#13;
In an attempt to help people control obesity, governments have adopted food labeling laws for restaurants. Under sec­tion 4205 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, FDA was directed to develop regulations on res­taurant menu-labeling requirements concerning calories in items for sale.61 The regulations will apply to restaurants, similar retail food establishments, and vending machine op­erators that are part of a chain with 20 or more locations or 20 or more vending machines.&#13;
In August of 2010, FDA released its draft guidance concern­ing the implementation of these menu-labeling provisions, which was subsequently withdrawn.62 The federal regula­tions, when adopted, will preempt local and state regula­tions. In April 2011, FDA issued a proposed rule to be added to the food labeling rules.63 One important pronouncement was that additional restaurant and vending machine opera­tors could voluntarily elect to become subject to the feder­al regulations and thereby avoid having to comply with state and local regulations. Other information suggests the label­ing information would be expensive for the industry.&#13;
C. Recombinant Bovine Somatotropin&#13;
The first genetically-engineered animal drug available for use was recombinant bovine somatotropin (hereafter: rbST). &#13;
FDA gave its approval for the product in November 1993 and decided that section 403(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act precluded certain labeling claims. A food is misbranded if statements on its label or in its labeling are false or misleading. Moreover, the absence of informa­tion relevant to the issue may cause labeling to be mislead­ing. Thus, misbranding precludes information that without further details might be expected to mislead. Due to the fact that natural bST is in all milk, FDA felt that truthful infor­mation means that labels cannot say that milk is ‘bST free.’ Moreover, FDA maintained that a label saying that milk is ‘rbST free’ may convey the idea that there exists a meaning­ful distinction between milk from cows that have been treat­ed with rbST and those that have not been treated. Although there is a distinction in the way milk is produced, FDA found no meaningful distinction in the milk.&#13;
To prevent misleading information, differentiation between rbST and bST may be achieved by a statement that the milk comes ‘from cows not treated with rbST,’ but must also have a statement that: ‘No significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rbST-treated and non-rbST-treat­ed cows.’ In 2010, a federal appellate court found some la­beling restrictions of rbST under Ohio law to be unconstitu­tional in International Dairy Foods Association v. Boggs.64 The restrictions by Ohio followed FDA’s guidance by plac­ing a prophylactic ban on milk composition claims includ­ing ‘rbST free.’65 The plaintiffs argued this regulation vio­lated their commercial free speech.&#13;
The International Dairy Foods Association court decided that there was a compositional difference between milk from untreated cows and conventional milk. By giving credence to evidence of elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 and higher somatic cell counts, the court found a compo­sitional difference.66 With this distinction, milk from cows not treated with rbST is ‘rbST free.’ However, milk from cows treated with rbST might contain rbST, although there exists no way to determine whether this is the case. The court thereby decided that dairy processors should be able to make claims that the milk is ‘rbST free.’&#13;
5 Conclusory Comments&#13;
With increases in the world’s population, large numbers of people desiring more meat products, the diversion of crops to produce energy, and enhanced expectations for doing more to enhance environmental quality and social well-be­ing, rural America and food production continue to change. Perhaps the most significant trend and development is the demand for agricultural crops to be used in energy produc­tion.&#13;
A second trend concerns social changes that are reflected in laws, regulations, and voluntary actions. Consumers are de­manding more information on labels about their food prod­ucts, such as labeling regarding the non-use of rBST, label­ing on calories, and information on animal welfare. Some Americans are willing to pay more for products with attri­butes they find laudable and for food produced locally, while others are expressing their concerns about the treatment of food animals. Americans are following Europeans in requir­ing production practices to reduce unnecessary pain or suf­fering of animals being raised for food.&#13;
Three recent developments may not be positive. Govern­mental support for biofuel production, expanding raw milk sales, and payments for property losses in eradicating a dis­ease may detract from social goals. First, the use of signif­icant quantities of corn and soybeans for the production of biofuel appears to be contributing to higher food costs, in­creases in feed costs for livestock, and rising prices for farm land. Second, the sale of raw milk may expose persons to unnecessary risk of disease. Third, payments to destroy dis­ease-vector plants may reduce incentives to control disease, leading to the establishment of new diseases and increases in production costs in the long run.&#13;
The raw milk and controlling citrus canker developments suggest a trend of placing liberty interests above public health and social objectives. Some Americans want to have the freedom ‘to assume risks that accompany their choices of engaging in life’s activities.’67 Questions remain whether these developments constitute a movement to place private property rights above the public good. Hopefully, legislative bodies and the judiciary will recognize that private property rights exist under a democracy in order to support the public good. Americans need to recognize that actions benefitting the majority may be preferred over rules that recognize indi­vidual property rights that impinge on total social welfare.&#13;
