Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;The United Kingdom (UK) Referendum of 23 June 2016 produced a majority of 51.9 per cent in favour of leaving the European Union (EU), as opposed to 48.1 per cent against. Subsequently, on 29 March 2017, the UK formally served notice of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union.[2] And, in consequence, the EU Treaties will cease to apply to the UK two years from this notification unless the European Council, in agreement with the UK, unanimously decides to extend the two-year period.[3] The potential impact of such events on UK agriculture is, without doubt, immense. Not only has the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) delivered substantial support to farmers, amounting to €3,927 million for the EU 2016 financial year,[4] but broader EU regulation has influenced heavily so many aspects of primary production, with increasing emphasis on measures to address the environment, climate change and the use of both pesticides and herbicides. Further, Brexit has the capacity materially to disturb trade flows if the UK leaves the Single Market. And, in this regard, the exposure of the Netherlands is particularly great, in that the Netherland is the EU country which exports the most food, feed and drink to the UK, some £5.1 billion in value in 2016.[5] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="bold"&gt;In this context, the agricultural landscape in the UK will first be outlined, with particular reference to its diversity not only in terms of farming structures, but also in terms of regulation, with agriculture being one of the areas where powers have been &lt;/span&gt;‘devolved’ to the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales. Thereafter attention will be directed to two specific aspects of post-Brexit UK agriculture, namely the potential architecture of any future direct payments regime for farmers and international trade. In the former case, there would seem to be a high level of certainty that farmers will continue to receive support; and policy development is increasingly coalescing around a shift from payment per hectare to payment for the delivery of ‘public goods’, with priority for high standards of environmental protection and animal welfare. In the latter case, there is general acceptance that post-Brexit the UK will be an individual member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and negotiate in its own right (as opposed to through membership of the EU), but WTO rules are likely to generate challenges both for a ‘public goods’ model of support for farmers and, more broadly, for the import and export of agricultural products, not least through the possibility that tariffs may be imposed on trade between the UK and the EU. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. The UK Agricultural Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK agri-food sector in 2015 accounted for a total estimated Gross Value Added (GVA) of £109 billion, some 6.6 per cent of national GVA.[6] However, in terms of international trade, it is a sector locked into structural deficit, with the majority of this being incurred in trade with other EU Member States.[7] Indeed, although in 2016 exports of food, feed and drink reached record levels, the deficit grew by 5.7 per cent to £22.4 billion.[8] Further, ‘agriculture’ as more narrowly defined represents a distinctly smaller proportion of the national economy, accounting for less than 1 per cent in 2016, although the importance of such primary production varies considerably between the constituent parts of the UK: for example, in 2015 agriculture contributed 0.46 per cent of total GVA in England, but 1.10 per cent in Northern Ireland, with the difference being even greater in terms of employment (1.06 per cent in England, but 5.68 per cent in Northern Ireland).[9] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This regional differentiation is also very apparent in term of farming structures. While the average size of farms in the UK is large by EU standards (being some 84 hectares in 2010),[10] this overall figure does not immediately reveal the extent of variation both between the constituent parts of the UK and within those constituent parts. For example, in June 2016 the average size of holdings in Northern Ireland was only 41 hectares, whereas in Scotland it was 109 hectares.[11] And, in Scotland as at the same date, as few as 9 per cent of holdings covered 76 per cent of land, as opposed to 52 per cent of holdings covering 1.6 per cent, the latter percentage reflecting the high number of small farms and crofts located within areas such as the Highlands.[12] In turn, there is great variety in terms of farm type, with livestock production being of notable importance in Scotland, consistent with the vast majority of all agricultural land being located in less-favoured areas.[13] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A matter of much relevance in terms of post-Brexit support to farmers is that these disparities in terms of farm size and farm type are matched by disparities in terms of CAP receipts across the UK. Thus, CAP allocations for the period 2014-2020 saw 65.5 per cent of Pillar I support attributable to England and 9.2 per cent attributable to Northern Ireland,[14] a very different proportion to their respective overall populations (estimated in 2016 to be 55,268,100 for England and 1,862,100 for Northern Ireland).[15] And this has given rise to serious concerns in the devolved administrations that post-Brexit their proportionate level of funding will decrease: indeed, in the view of Fergus Ewing of the Scottish Government, ‘moving to a population share of this essential support could result in Scotland losing around half the current CAP allocation’.[16] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, as indicated, agriculture is an area where powers have been ‘devolved’ to the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales,[17] with a consequence being that the devolved administrations have already implemented significantly different agricultural policies. For example, in line with the predominance of livestock production on less-favoured areas in Scotland, the focus of the Scottish Rural Development Programme for 2014-2020 has been on support for such areas, which may be contrasted with focus on agri-environmental measures in England.[18] Further, only in Scotland has there been specific coupled support for beef and sheep production (until 2015 the Scottish Beef Calf Scheme and now the Scottish Suckler Beef Support Scheme (Mainland and Islands) and the Scottish Upland Sheep Support Scheme).[19]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential for this constitutional settlement to generate tensions has found concrete expression in the agricultural arena. In particular, in the case of &lt;span class="italic"&gt;The Queen (on the application of Horvath) v Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&lt;/span&gt; there was challenge to national implementing measures which imposed on farmers in England (but not in Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales) certain obligations under the ‘cross-compliance’ regime relating to visible public rights of way.[20] In the event, the challenge was not successful, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) deciding that, where the constitutional system of a Member State provides that devolved administrations are to have legislative competence, the mere adoption by those administrations of different cross-compliance criteria did not constitute discrimination contrary to Community law.[21] But there is nonetheless increasing evidence that Brexit will exacerbate competition between central UK Government and the devolved administrations as to the extent of their respective powers to legislate on agriculture following withdrawal from the EU. Not least, when the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill was presented to the UK Parliament in July 2017, the Scottish and Welsh Governments were swift to maintain that it would require legislative consent from Scotland and Wales, on the basis that it provided for powers returning from the EU to pass solely to the UK Government and Parliament.[22] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Future Direct Payments to Farmers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As has been seen, the scale of payments to UK farmers under the CAP is very considerable, amounting to €3,927 million for the EU 2016 financial year. However, the UK Government has for some time regarded it as a policy preference to move away from Pillar I direct payments which still form the bulk of support to farmers: to take again the example of the EU 2016 financial year, out of the total CAP expenditure in the UK of €3,927 million, €3,035 million was spent on direct payments under Pillar I, which may be compared with €86 million on market, price support, again under Pillar I, and €806 million on rural development measures under Pillar II (including national co-financing).[23] Thus, intimations of such a preference for a shift of from direct payments under Pillar I to rural development support under Pillar II could be found as far back as the 2005 policy document issued by the UK Treasury and DEFRA, &lt;span class="italic"&gt;Vision for the Common Agricultural Policy&lt;/span&gt;;[24] and, shortly before the Referendum, this approach was reiterated by the Minister for Agriculture, George Eustice, who stated that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[w]e continue to believe that expenditure on market price support and direct payments to farmers under Pillar 1 of the CAP represents very poor value for money. The UK has always made clear that we would like to move away from subsidies in the long run. However, we recognise that there is scope for using taxpayers’ money to pay farmers for public goods that the market otherwise would not reward, such as protecting the natural environment, supporting biodiversity and improving animal welfare.[25] &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, soon after the Referendum there was reassurance from the UK Government that overall levels of expenditure would remain the same until the end of the EU Multiannual Financial Framework in 2020, with allocation being made in accordance with the principles of Pillar I of the CAP.[26] And the Conservative Party Manifesto prior to the June 2017 General Election saw the timescale extended further, stating that ‘we will continue to commit the same cash total in funds for farm support until the end of the parliament’.[27] On the other hand, although such an extension of current levels of expenditure does provide a significant degree of longer-term financial security, it could not be considered a far distant horizon in farming terms; and it may also be noted that the Conservative Party Manifesto did not expressly mention the allocation of funds using the principles of Pillar 1 of the CAP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, and consistent with policy preferences demonstrated prior to the Referendum, there is increasing evidence that the focus of post-Brexit support for farmers is likely to be payment for the delivery of ‘public goods’.[28] For example, early in 2017 before the House of Lords European Union Energy and Environment Sub-Committee, the Minister for Agriculture, George Eustice, affirmed that ‘rewarding farmers for what they do for the environment’ was ‘a legitimate aim of public policy’.[29] And more recently, in his key speech entitled &lt;span class="italic"&gt;The Unfrozen Moment – Delivering a Green Brexit&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="italic"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;the new Secretary of State for Environment, Michael Gove, foresaw emphasis on the two ‘public goods’ of environmental protection and animal welfare, declaring that, ‘alongside encouraging greater bio-diversity and the way in which farmers manage their land, I also want to see higher standards across the board of animal welfare’.[30] Indeed, with specific reference to animal welfare, the UK enjoys a history of anticipating or exceeding EU minimum standards: for example, closely-confined sow stalls in the pig sector were banned in the UK as from 1 January 1999, but such a ban only became applicable to all holdings under EU legislation on 1 January 2013, and then subject to exceptions.[31] Further, it was the UK Government which on animal welfare grounds imposed restrictions on the export to Spain of live animals for slaughter; and it was a UK non-governmental organisation which sought that the UK Government to restrict the export of live calves so as to prevent them being reared in the veal crate system (both forms of restrictions being found inconsistent with EU law by the CJEU).[32]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, there are firm indications of an intention to position UK agriculture as both sensitive to the environment and ambitious in terms of farm animal welfare, with these characteristics being also perceived as capable of securing advantage in international markets. That having been said, it would be correct to acknowledge a strand of UK Government thinking which retains focus on a more ‘productivist’ model. Not least, the Secretary of State in the same &lt;span class="italic"&gt;Unfrozen Moment &lt;/span&gt;speech saw his role as being to support farmers ‘to grow, produce and sell more’.[33] Likewise, the importance of providing food to feed the nation is also emphasised by the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), for which a key goal post-Brexit is ‘[c]reating a Domestic Agriculture Policy which promotes productivity’.[34]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any event, debate is already commencing as to how a ‘public goods’ model of this kind might be implemented. For example, a ‘pure’ version has been advocated by the UK Government adviser, Professor Dieter Helm, under which public funds would be employed to purchase the relevant ‘public goods’ by means of direct contracts through public bodies; and, significantly, while farmers were considered to be in an advantageous position to win these direct contracts, it was also considered appropriate that others should enter the ‘market’.[35] A broadly similar approach has been put forward by the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), where ‘land management contracts’ would be introduced as vehicles ‘by which farmers, foresters and land managers are rewarded for their time, costs and expertise in managing land in ways that benefit society’.[36] A key challenge, nonetheless, as fully recognised by the CLA, would be to put into practice bespoke land management contracts which were so targeted as to deliver the maximum ‘public good’ from each farm, it being envisaged that a long period would be required so as to allow for policy design before commencing transition to the new regime, with provisions also being made for the use of pilot schemes. Further, it has long been recognised that there are hurdles to clear in securing proper monitoring of ‘public good’ measures of this kind.[37] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. International Trade&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As indicated, it is generally accepted that post-Brexit the UK will be a member of the WTO and entitled to negotiate in its own right.[38] On the other hand, pre-Brexit, the UK would not appear able to conclude free trade agreements;[39] and the Director-General of the WTO has also indicated that, on Brexit, ‘[k]ey aspects of the EU’s terms of trade could not simply be cut and pasted for the UK’, with the result that ‘important elements would need to be negotiated’.[40] In this context, four specific aspects of WTO rules may be considered which have particular resonance for future UK agricultural policy: first, the extent to which the UK will become entitled to a share of the permitted level of domestic support to farmers as currently scheduled in the name of the EU; secondly, the extent to which the envisaged ‘public goods’ model of domestic support would be compatible with WTO rules; thirdly, the potential effect of tariffs; and finally, the scope which WTO rules might allow the UK to restrict imports on the basis of environmental and animal welfare standards, so sheltering domestic producers from products produced to lower standards.[41]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4.1. Permitted Levels of Domestic Support&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA), WTO members are obliged to maintain the provision of trade-distorting Amber Box domestic support within the level as determined by reference to their respective ‘schedules’;[42] and an important consideration is that the relevant schedule is currently in the name of the EU, without distinction between Member States (including the UK). Further, there does not seem to be any rule in the URAA which expressly stipulates how the UK might establish its own schedule post-Brexit. In such circumstances, the EU and UK have declared an intention that apportionment will take place ‘on the basis of an objective methodology’.[43] However, the precise nature of this objective methodology remains to be resolved.[44] One possibility might be determination by reference to the contribution of UK domestic support to the permitted overall ‘Base Total Aggregate Measurement of Support’ for the EU when the URAA was first concluded, in essence the UK receiving back what it had originally contributed. Another possibility might be that suggested by the UK Minister for Agriculture, George Eustice, who looked to a UK entitlement ‘based on our allocation of the CAP budget’.[45] On the other hand, even if agreement can be reached between the EU and UK, such agreement might not be conclusive of the matter in that any required certification of the newly established schedules of the EU and UK may not prove a smooth procedure.[46] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4.2. The Compatibility of a ‘Public Goods’ Model of Domestic Support with WTO Rules&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of current EU domestic support is understood to be exempt from reduction commitments under the URAA on the basis that the measures concerned qualify for the Green Box under Annex 2. By way of illustration, the recently published WTO notification by the EU in respect of domestic support declared total Green Box support of €68,697.8 million, as opposed to total trade-distorting Amber Box support of only €5,971.7 million.[47] It may be apprehended that the UK will likewise seek to obtain Green Box exemption for its domestic support post-Brexit, but the adoption of a ‘public goods’ model may present some challenges, of which two may be highlighted. First, although paragraph 12 of Annex 2 to the URAA, confers exemption on ‘payments under environmental programmes’, the detailed rules limit the amount of payment ‘to the extra costs or loss of income involved in complying with the government programme’; and, although there is no certainty as to how the provisions might be interpreted, this would seem to preclude an incentive element or, indeed, more generally a transfer of resources to farmers.[48] Secondly, there is currently no express exemption for animal welfare payments under Annex 2, a state of affairs much regretted by the Minister for Agriculture, George Eustice, who observed in early 2017 that: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;the types of policies that would be more modern, more progressive - payments to get animal welfare outcomes, risk management measures, those types of things - we understand, at the moment, would probably be deemed under the WTO rules as amber box’.[49] &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That having been said, the list of exempt Green Box ‘direct payments to producers’ as set out in Annex 2 would not seem to be exhaustive in that paragraph 5 of Annex 2 refers to exemption also being claimed ‘for any existing or new type of direct payment’ other than those specifically mentioned. Qualification, however, remains dependent upon meeting a range of detailed criteria, one being that no production shall be required for their receipt.[50] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4.3. The Potential Effect of Tariffs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event that a free trade agreement is not concluded between the EU and the UK, trade would be conducted between the remaining 27 Member States and the UK under WTO rules and, in consequence, a significant concern would be the high levels of tariff which apply in the agri-food sector: for example, the rate is 10 per cent in the case of cars, but about 45 per cent on average for beverages and confectionery.[51] Moreover, with regard to primary agricultural products, tariffs are particularly high on those widely exported from the UK to other EU Member States, such as beef and lamb.[52] And this has prompted expressions of anxiety from areas which are dependent upon livestock production, such as Wales, it being estimated that no less than 30 per cent of Welsh lamb is consumed in the EU.[53] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such effects would be all the greater if post-Brexit the UK were unilaterally to remove all import tariffs, as has been advocated by Economists for Free Trade, in whose view ‘[a]n optimal strategy with goods could be the government announcing that it is (1) unilaterally adopting WTO rules with zero import tariffs and (2) at the same time, embarking on establishing FTAs with like-minded countries that wish to eliminate the more important and broader areas of non-tariff barriers and other trade distortions’.[54] Such a course of action would be likely to deliver a political dividend in terms of cheaper food prices, but the consequences would potentially be very adverse for UK farmers as they faced tariffs on export while seeking to compete with imports subject to no such burden. In the absence of substantial domestic support to ‘bridge the gap’, the financial viability of many operators could be placed in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4.4. Restricting Imports on the Basis of Environmental and Animal Welfare Standards&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ‘public goods’ model could be accompanied by measures to restrict imports based upon environmental and animal welfare standards, in order to allay concerns articulated by both non-governmental organisations and the industry that farmers complying with domestic high standards would be at a disadvantage if farmers exporting to the UK were free to produce without such constraint.[55] Indeed, the House of Lords European Union Committee has declared that ‘[o]ur evidence strongly suggests that the greatest threat to farm animal welfare standards post-Brexit would come from UK farmers competing against cheap, imported food from countries that produce to lower standards than the UK’.[56] In this context, a degree of urgency has been generated by the possibility of a free trade agreement being concluded with the United States which permitted the importation of chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef, although such an approach has been strongly disavowed by the Secretary of State for Environment.[57] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With reference to WTO law, the validity of restrictions of this kind has been much contested. Not least, there has been vigorous debate as to the extent to which members may condition imports on the basis of process and production methods which do not find their way into the end-product (‘non-product-related process and production methods’ or ‘NPR-PPMs’);[58] and many restrictions directed to environmental and animal welfare considerations would seem to fall into this category: for example, there may be no readily detectable physical difference between pigmeat produced with the use of closely-confined sow stalls and pigmeat produced ‘free range’. Further, WTO jurisprudence confirms that any such measures introduced by the importing member must be carefully drawn so as to avoid discrimination or disguised protectionism, as may be illustrated by the recent decision of the Appellate Body in in &lt;span class="italic"&gt;EC – Seal Products&lt;/span&gt;.[59] &lt;span class="italic"&gt;Prima facie &lt;/span&gt;an EU prohibition of the importation and sale of processed and unprocessed seal products was found to be&lt;span class="italic"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;justified under Article XX(a) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in that it was ‘necessary to protect public morals’. Yet the detailed measures implementing the prohibition failed to meet the requirements of the &lt;span class="italic"&gt;chapeau&lt;/span&gt; covering all measures for which exemption is claimed under Article XX, namely that they ‘are not applied in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade’: for example, an exception from the prohibition had been granted to the Inuit or other indigenous communities, but the Appellate Body was not persuaded that the EU had made comparable efforts to facilitate access to the exception in the case of Canadian Inuit as it had done in the case of Greenlandic Inuit.[60] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the words of the Secretary of State for Environment, Michael Gove, Brexit offers an ‘unfrozen moment’ as the UK leaves the CAP to develop a new and ambitious UK agricultural policy.[61] And there have already been reassurances that levels of funding to the sector will be maintained beyond the end of the EU Multiannual Financial Framework in 2020 until at least the end of the current UK Parliament. Further, increasing focus can be detected on an agricultural policy which seeks to promote high standards of environmental protection and animal welfare; and this focus chimes well with previous UK initiatives, such as the early ban on closely-confined sow stalls, while there is also evidence that it will enjoy popular support: for example, the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty has over 4 million members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, much of the detailed operation of the proposed regime remains as yet not clearly defined and there are liable to be significant regulatory hurdles, of which three may specifically be mentioned. First, there is ongoing tension between central UK Government and the devolved administrations as to who will pull the levers of power in the agricultural sector post-Brexit, with the position exacerbated by the strong attachment to farming for not only economic, but also social and cultural reasons in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.[62] Secondly, while Brexit will offer the opportunity to put in place environmental measures more closely targeted to national conditions, it may prove no easy task to construct a legislative framework which, on the one hand, accommodates the local and even individual priorities of the farming community and, on the other hand, works effectively in terms of the regulatory burden and level of transaction costs. In particular, there may be resistance to increased regulation when a key argument for supporters of Brexit was to ‘take back control’. Thirdly, withdrawal from the EU has material implications in terms of international trade, with these implications being all the greater if no free trade agreement is reached with the EU. Not least, WTO rules have the capacity to impact upon the design of support regimes, while a material consideration is that the pursuit of high standards of environmental protection and animal welfare may leave farmers at a competitive disadvantage in international markets. Although there would seem to be scope under WTO rules to provide domestic support to assist farmers in meeting these high standards, and even to condition imports, history suggests that to do so successfully requires great attention to detail in the legislative process, with an eye always to avoiding any form of discrimination or disguised protectionism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does nonetheless seem clear is that, post-Brexit, agriculture in the UK is to continue to be treated differently to other industries and, even if the sector never dominates budgets as the CAP has dominated the budget of the EU, it is likely to retain a special place in national policy-making and further capture the public imagination: definitely, the prospect of imports of chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef generated high profile headlines in national newspapers.[63] Accordingly, a ‘Green Brexit’ may yet be delivered, but the road to achieving this may not prove to be smooth, whether at home or on the international stage, and for the time being farmers are operating in an environment of considerable uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</content><legacyfootnotes/><footnotes><footnote>1 Professor of Agricultural Law, University of Leeds, United Kingdom.</footnote><footnote>2 The delay in serving the Article 50(2) notice was in part attributable to court proceedings to establish whether such withdrawal from the EU could be carried into effect through the prerogative powers of the UK Government or whether a legislative act of Parliament was required, the Supreme Court deciding that legislation was indeed necessary: &lt;span class="italic"&gt;R (on the application of Miller and another) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union&lt;/span&gt; [2017] UKSC 5.</footnote><footnote>3 Treaty on European Union, Article 50(3).

Central to the argument of the Scottish and Welsh Governments is the ‘Sewel Convention’, Lord Sewel having stated in in the UK Parliament during the passage of the Scotland Bill 1997-98 that ‘we would expect a convention to be established that Westminster would not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters in Scotland without the consent of the Scottish Parliament’: HL Deb 21 July 1998 Vol 592 c 791. The status of the Sewel Convention, however, remains that of a convention and it has not been elevated to a legal rule justiciable by the courts: &lt;span class="italic"&gt;R (on the application of Miller and another) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union&lt;/span&gt; [2017] UKSC 5, at [148].</footnote><footnote>23 DEFRA et al (note 4) Table 10.7.</footnote><footnote>24 United Kingdom Treasury and DEFRA, &lt;span class="italic"&gt;A Vision for the Common Agricultural Policy&lt;/span&gt; (London, 2005).</footnote><footnote>25 House of Commons Written Answer 221523 (27 January 2015) (available at http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2015-01-21/221523/%5d).</footnote><footnote>26 Letter from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (12 August 2016) (available at https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/545767/CST_letter_to_SoS_for_DExEU_August_2016.PDF).</footnote><footnote>27 &lt;span class="italic"&gt;Forward Together: Our Plan for a Stronger Britain and a Prosperous Future – The Conservative and Unionist Party Manifesto 2017&lt;/span&gt;, 26 (available at https://www.conservatives.com/manifesto).
