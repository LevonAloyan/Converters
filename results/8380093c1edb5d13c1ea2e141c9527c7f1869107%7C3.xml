INTRODUCTION&#13;
In the US, as in the Netherlands, agricultural activities affect the natural environment. Farmers plow and cultivate, apply farm chemicals, raise livestock, irrigate, dredge and fill, operate noisy machinery, dry grain, and burn straw.1 Moreover, changes in US agricultural structure in recent decades have escalated the impact of agriculture on the environment. The shift to capital-intensive agriculture, with the use of more chemicals and heavy equipment; the significant expansion of average farm size; and the trend toward concentrated animal feeding operations have brought potential for increased pollution.2&#13;
Soil sediments result from erosion, a natural process exacerbated by agricultural cultivation. Nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) are applied as fertilizers and occur in livestock wastes; excess amounts leach into groundwater or accompany soil sediments into surface waters. Pesticides (herbicides, insecticides, fungicides) are commonly applied to crops to control weeds, insects, and plant diseases. These toxic chemicals are major polluters of surface and ground water. Mineral salts occur naturally in water, but irrigation concentrates these salts in the soil or, through irrigation return flows, in water bodies. Heavy metals and disease organisms are found in livestock manure and may also pollute waters.3&#13;
In the United States, agriculture has been recognized as 'the remaining, major unregu-lated source of environmental... pollutants.'4 That is, despite the serious impact of agricultural pollution, little direct environmental regulation of farming practices has occurred and, in the past, some federal farm policies have even encouraged environmentally harm-ful practices. Agriculture has sometimes enjoyed exclusions from environmental com-mand-and-control regulations. Voluntary, rather than regulatory, programs (sometimes with incentives to induce compliance) have been instituted to address some forms of agricultural pollution. In terms of voluntary programs, a 1995 US government report identified 17 incentive-based conservation programs for farmers and ranchers, many of them long-standing and most designed to reduce soil erosion. Ten were cost-share programs that provided federal funding for a substantial part (50-80%) of various conservation efforts. Seven were land-retirement programs with payments for temporary retirement of land or for purchase of a conservation easement. Most involved contracts with individual land users. In recent years, an annual average of about 565,000 agreements supported conservation measures on about 71 million acres (28.8 million hectares) of agricultural land.5&#13;
Much of the lenient regulatory attitude toward agriculture can be traced to the special status of family farming in American society. But recent structural changes, especially the development of industrial-scale farming, mean that agriculture is often a complex business enterprise instead of a small family operation. Increasingly, the public perception is that agriculture, like other businesses, should be required to take account of its environ-mental problems.6 Thus, more stringent federal and state regulation of farming practices is to be expected.7&#13;
Of course, federal and state law in the US does include environmental regulation of agriculture. For example, in the area of livestock waste, the federal Clean Water Act treats large concentrated animal feeding operations as point sources of water pollution; effluent limitations and performance standards apply, and special permits are required.8 In contrast, smaller livestock facilities are considered nonpoint sources, which are governed by Clean Water Act provisions that assign responsibility to states for water quality planning and management.9 State planning under these provisions has not been particularly effec-tive in controlling agricultural nonpoint-source pollution.&#13;
Some individual states have recently strengthened their regulation of livestock waste. In Pennsylvania, for example, a 1993 law requires certain animal operations to develop and implement nutriënt management plans.10 In Illinois, a new Livestock Management Facilities Act imposes standards for construction of livestock waste lagoons, establishes limitations on application of waste, and requires new facilities to be set back from residences and populated areas.11 Other states have enacted laws in recent years, and more are expected.&#13;
Agricultural pesticides are regulated, too, by federal and state laws. Most important is the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA),12 a market access law, which governs registration, labeling, and use of pesticides. States also have significant authority to regulate pesticides, and many states have enacted laws and regulations.13&#13;
Protection of wetlands is an important component of US agro-environmental law, especially because draining and clearing for agriculture caused most of the serious wetlands loss over the last two centuries. At least 25 federal statutes regulate various issues connected with wetlands, and six federal agencies are involved. Among the programs authorized by these laws are acquisition of wetlands or easements on wetlands, restoration of damaged wetlands, creation of new wetlands, regulation of activities carried out on wetlands, and restrictions to avoid further loss of wetlands.14 The main federal law, Clean Water Act § 404,15 requires a permit for discharge of dredged or fill material into the na-vigable waters of the US, including wetlands adjacent to those waters. Some states also regulate to protect wetlands.&#13;
US agricultural land, including wetlands, includes vulnerable habitat of plant and ani-mal species, and some of that habitat is protected by federal law. The Endangered Species Act16 helps to conserve ecosystems of endangered and threatened species and to protect the species themselves. Many species protected under the ESA have habitat on privately-owned land.17 A recent decision of the US Supreme Court held that the ESA may apply to prevent * significant habitat modification or degradation that actually kills or injures wild-life', even on private land, when that modification will harm a protected animal species.18&#13;
The most recent federal law affecting agriculture resources is the new US farm legislation, the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996.19 Title III of that law includes the conservation provisions that are the major focus of this article. After some brief background, this article will discuss the important conservation initiatives in the 1996 Farm BUL. </inleiding><content>II. CONSERVATION OF AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES UNDER 1996 US FARM LEGISLATION&#13;
A. Background&#13;
Since the 1930s, the US government has encouraged conservation of agricultural resources and prevention of soil erosion. Within the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), a number of agencies have implemented conservation programs. The Soil Conservation Service (SCS) took an active role, particularly in providing technical assistance for soil conservation practices. The SCS often cooperated with local soil conservation districts. The Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), which adminis-tered price and income support programs, was also involved in soil conservation, with authority to provide cost-share incentives. The SCS focus on public goals, coupled with ASCS emphasis on benefits for individual farmers, engendered conflict. Perhaps in com-petition for farmers' loyalty, both agencies eventually promoted production rather than conservation.20 Effective practices to control soil erosion gradually succumbed to press-ures for increased production. Indeed, as one commentator suggested, 'the primary reason for agriculture's general abandonment of soil conserving practices is that the lead federal agency - the SCS - shifted its emphasis from soil erosion control to production enhance-ment,' thus acquiescing in the abandonment of proven soil conservation practices.21&#13;
To enhance conservation, the Food Security Act of 198522 included several innovative programs designed to protect fragile rural land, and the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 199023 amended and extended these initiatives. An October 1994 reor-ganization of the USDA changed the structure of that agency.24 Functions of the SCS are now carried out by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS); functions of the ASCS are carried out by the Consolidated Farm Service Agency (CFSA). Most recently, in April 1996, the new Farm Bill, the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996,25 made further amendments and introduced new conservation programs. An overview of this comprehensive new farm bill, which fills 309 printed pages, is beyond the scope of this paper. But it is important to note that the law - called FAIR - drastically changes the structure of US support for agriculture. The Agricultural Market Transition Act (Title I of FAIR) suspends the price support and production adjustment provisions of earlier farm legislation. FAIR authorizes guaranteed annual payments, in declining amounts from 1996 to 2002, to producers who participated in the farm program for at least one erop year between 1991 and 1995. Producers will receive payments under 'production flexibility contracts.' An extremely short sign-up period (20 May to 12 July 1996) determines eligibility for the whole seven-year period. Participants will receive payments on 85% of contract acreage and can choose the crops to be planted (with some restrictions on fruits and vegetables). No set-aside will be imposed.&#13;
FAIR continues important conservation efforts. Amended 'swampbuster' and 'sodbus-ter' provisions and an expanded Environmental Conservation Acreage Reserve Program (ECARP) are particularly important. Sodbuster and swampbuster date from 1985 and represent a reversal of earlier farm policy, which indirectly encouraged farmers to convert erodible land or wetlands to farming use by providing farm program benefits for the con-verted lands. Unlike earlier federal conservation efforts, which were often voluntary, sodbuster and swampbuster tied compliance to eligibility for federal farm program benefits. That is, a farmer had to comply with conservation requirements to receive payments under USDA price support, storage, insurance, disaster, and loan programs for any com-modity produced that year, as well as for certain other federal conservation payments.26 Under the 1996 provisions of FAIR, farmers must continue to comply with sodbuster and swampbuster requirements to qualify for contract payments under a production flexibility contract, marketing assistance loans, and other payments.&#13;
B. Highly Erodible Land Conservation (Sodbuster)&#13;
The sodbuster provisions27 focus on conservation of highly erodible land, as defined by law. Farmers who produce agricultural commodities on fields in which highly erodible lands predominate are not eligible for USDA financial benefits (including the new contract payments under a production flexibility contract) unless their land is operated ac-cording to an approved conservation compliance plan. These plans, subject to approval by the local soil conservation district and the NRCS, generally require achievement of ero-sion control through structural practices, such as terraces and grass waterways, or farming techniques, such as management of erop residues. Some exemptions from loss of benefits apply, e.g., for minor violations or temporary variances because of weather, pest, or dis-ease problems. FAIR added a more protective good faith exemption. A farmer who viol-ates the sodbuster provisions, but who has acted in good faith and without intent to violate, will be given up to a year to implement a conservation plan without losing benefits.&#13;
To protect farmers economically, FAIR now requires the NRCS to ensure that pres-cribed conservation systems are 'technically and economically feasible,* 'based on local resource conditions and available conservation technology,' 'cost-effective,' and that they do not 'cause undue economie hardship' on the producer.28 If application of a producer's conservation system would impose an undue economie hardship, the producer is entitled to relief to avoid that hardship.&#13;
C. Wetland Conservation (Swampbuster)&#13;
The swampbuster provisions recognize the importance of wetlands for wildlife habitat, groundwater recharge, stream quality, flood control, and shoreline protection. Under FAIR, the USDA alone carries out wetlands programs on agricultural land, with responsi-bility assigned to NRCS. Consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and officials of the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service is no longer required, but may occur.29&#13;
Wetlands are defined as land with hydric soils, wetland hydrology, and hydrophytic vegetation. The USDA will identify wetlands on wetland delineation maps; when requested by the landowner, identifïcation will occur after an on-site wetland determina-tion.30 Current wetland identifications will be valid unless the producer asks for a review.&#13;
Under the swampbuster provisions31 farmers who produce an agricultural commodity on wetlands are ineligible for specified USDA loans and payments, including conserva-tion payments, during that erop year. FAIR gives the Secretary of Agriculture discretion to determine which loans and payments the producer cannot receive. The amount of ine-ligibility is proportionate to the severity of the violation. This flexibility to assess penal-ties is new in FAIR.&#13;
Moreover, farmers who convert wetlands (after 28 November 1990) to make agricultural production possible are ineligible for USDA payments and loans for the current and all subsequent erop years.&#13;
Exemptions from loss of benefits apply to production on wetlands converted before 23 December 1985, wetlands that can be farmed by normal methods because of natural con-ditions (like drought), and certain wetlands converted before 23 December 1985 on which wetland characteristics returned through lack of management or restoration.&#13;
FAIR also amended the 'minimal effects' exemption, which provides that producers who farm on converted wetlands or convert wetlands for production may avoid ineligi-bility for benefits if their action will have a minimal effect on the value of wetlands in the area. Value here includes value to waterfowl and wildlife. Alternatively, producers can restore a converted wetland, enhance an existing wetland, or create a new wetland in the same general area of the watershed. The farmer must act in accordance with a conserva-tion plan, and the new wetland must be made subject to a public recorded easement to prevent alterations that would diminish its value.32&#13;
As under sodbuster, a good faith exemption applies if the producer has acted 'in good faith and without intent to violate' the wetlands provisions. The good faith violator will get a year to implement measures and practices to restore the wetland.33&#13;
D. Environmental Conservation Acreage Reserve Program&#13;
The 1990 Farm Bill created the Environmental Conservation Acreage Reserve Program (ECARP)34 to protect highly erodible lands, other fragile lands, and wetlands through contracts and acquisition of easements. FAIR amended and expanded this Program, which now includes the Conservation Reserve (established in 1985 to reduce soil erosion, decrease production, and support income and prices), the Wetlands Reserve (established in 1990), and an Environmental Quality Incentive Program.35 Thus, for the period 1996-2002, ECARP is designed 'to be implemented through contracts and the acquisition of easements to assist owners and operators of farms and ranches to conserve and enhance soil, water, and related natural resources, including grazing land, wetland, and wildlife habitat.'36 Preference for participation in these programs may go to producers in 'conservation priority areas' - land with special environmental sensitivity or where producers need help to comply with nonpoint source water pollution laws and other federal and state environmental laws.37 Financial and other limitations govern the programs. For example, not more than 25% of the cropland in any county can be enrolled in the Conservation Reserve and Wetlands Reserve, and not more than 10% of cropland in a county can be subject to an easement.38 These limitations help to protect local businesses that depend on production agriculture.&#13;
1. Conservation Reserve&#13;
The Conservation Reserve Program39 protects highly erodible cropland, certain marginal pasture lands, areas with identified water quality problems, and other fragile lands. Areas where agriculture harms water quality have received priority for enrollment. Producers bid to enter the CRP. Those whose bids are accepted enter contracts with the US government to retire land from production for 10 to 15 years, and agree to follow an approved conservation plan. In exchange, producers receive annual rental payments, technical assistance, and 50% cost-share payments for establishing approved vegetative cover or trees on CRP land. Though at first mostly whole fields were enrolled in the CRP, later 69 to 99 foot-wide strips of grass or trees adjacent to waterways were also included.&#13;
FAIR amended the CRP provisions to allow farmers whose CRP contracts have been in effect for at least five years to terminate those contracts early. Contracts on especially vulnerable land cannot be terminated. Vulnerable land includes strips adjacent to water areas, highly erodible land, and other areas (like wetlands) of great environmental value.40&#13;
At present about 36.4 million acres (14.7 million hectares) are enrolled in CRP.41 FAIR now limits the CRP program to 36.4 million acres at any one time (a decrease from the 45 million acres authorized in earlier legislation). The CRP limit is a rolling maximum; as CRP contracts end, other landowners may participate in the program.&#13;
Significant environmental benefits have resulted so far. Estimates suggests that trees will cover 2.5 million acres and that soil erosion on cropland will be reduced by an estimated 696 million tons per year, with accompanying reduction of sedimentation and pollution from farm chemicals.42 But the CRP has been costly and does not always protect the most vulnerable land.43 A 1995 government report suggested that in many cases 100-foot buffer zones adjacent to waterways or wetlands could achieve significant environmental benefits at much lower cost. Whole field enrollments would still be needed for wildlife habitat.44 Moreover, the CRP may only postpone environmental problems; when CRP contracts expire, the land may return to production. Though much of that land will be subject to the sodbuster conservation plan requirements, FAIR states that producers with highly-erodible lands that were subject to a CRP contract may not be held to a higher conservation Standard than other farmers with highly-erodible land in the same area.45&#13;
2. Wetlands Reserve&#13;
The Wetlands Reserve Program46 assists owners to restore and protect wetlands. FAIR continues the Program at a maximum of 975,000 acres (395,000 hectares). Beginning 1 October 1996, 'to the maximum extent practicable,' the authorized wetlands reserve areas are to be enrolled in three equal parts: permanent easements, 30-year easements, and restoration cost-share agreements.47&#13;
FAIR included a new condition for enrollment in the Wetlands Reserve: the land must maximize 'wildlife benefits and wetland values and functions.'48 The federal government will purchase permanent or 30-year easements on eligible wetlands, which will be subject to a wetland easement conservation plan. The plan will limit alteration of wildlife habitat, most application of Chemicals and mowing, crop production, and other incompatible activities. The government will share the cost of establishing conservation measures and protecting wetland values. Federal cost-share for permanent easements is 75-100% and for 30-year easements, 50-75%. Under restoration cost-share agreements, the landowner will restore wetlands, and the government will provide technical assistance and pay 50-75% of restoration costs.&#13;
3. Environmental Quality Incentives&#13;
Until the 1996 farm legislation, two further programs had existed. An environmental easements program authorized permanent easements to ensure long-term protection of en-vironmentally sensitive land, and a program of water quality incentives helped producers to develop on-farm water quality protection plans to reduce agricultural pollutants and wastes.49&#13;
FAIR establishes the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), which combines the water quality incentives program and several existing conservation programs.50 EQIP authorizes $1.2 billion (1996-2002) for conservation and environmental improve-ments on erop and livestock farms. Fifty percent of the money allocated each year is to be targeted for 'practices relating to livestock production.'51 Priority for participation in EQIP goes to areas of special environmental sensitivity designated as conservation priority areas by the Secretary of Agriculture,52 for payments that maximize environmental benefits per dollar expended, and to areas where states or local governments have programs for the same conservation or environmental purposes.&#13;
Under EQIP, USDA is authorized to provide technical assistance, cost-share payments, incentive payments, and education. Producers may enter into 5 to 10-year contracts with the government for carrying out 'structural practices' or 'land management practices' on 'eligible land.' Producers must implement an approved environmental quality incentives program plan that describes the conservation or environmental goal to be achieved through structural or land management practices.&#13;
'Eligible land' means agricultural land (cropland, rangeland, pasture), including land that poses a serious threat to soil, water, or related resources. A * structural practice' is the establishment of a site-specific facility, like an animal waste management plant, grassed waterway, terrace, permanent wildlife habitat, needed to protect resources from degradation. Tenants who propose structural practices must obtain agreement of the land owner. Cost-share payments, to a maximum of 75%, are available for structural practices. A producer who owns a 'large confined livestock operation' is not eligible for cost-share payments to construct an animal waste management facility. The size facility that is considered 'large' must be determined by the Secretary of Agriculture.53 A 'land management practice' includes site-specific nutriënt or manure management, integrated pest management, tillage management, and other practices. Producers who agree to carry out land management practices are eligible for incentive payments, at a rate to be determined by the Secretary of Agriculture. Technical assistance and education are available for both structural and land management practices. EQIP payments to an individual producer are normally limited to $10,000 per fiscal year and $50,000 for any multi-year contract.&#13;
4. Conservation Farm Option&#13;
Another new program in FAIR is the Conservation Farm Option, a pilot program for producers of wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice who have contract acreage in the agricultural market transition program (the production flexibility payments).54 The Conservation Farm Option allows producers to receive government subsidies and conservation incentive payments.55 lts goals include conservation of resources; water quality protection; wetland restoration, protection, and creation; and wildlife habitat development and protection. The Conservation Farm Option allows a producer to enter land into the program under a 10-year contract, with the possibility of a 5-year renewal. Participation requires approval of a conservation farm plan that describes erop rotations and other conservation practices and provides a schedule for implementation and maintenance of those practices. Participants must agree to keep records to aid in evaluating the program and to refrain from activities that would defeat its purposes.&#13;
The producer receives payments, calculated to be equivalent to those available under the CRP, WRP, or EQIP, but the producer may not participate in those programs. Producers may terminate a CRP contract to enter the Conservation Farm Option program, un-less net environmental benefits will be reduced.&#13;
E. Miscellaneous Conservation Provisions&#13;
FAIR also includes a number of provisions that create rather small-scale projects to ad-dress conservation of particular agricultural resources.&#13;
For example, the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program authorizes cost-share payments to allow landowners to develop habitat for 'upland wildlife, wetland wildlife, threatened and endangered species, fish, and other types of wildlife.' Details of the program will be determined by the Secretary of Agriculture, and only $50 million is available for seven years.56&#13;
The Farmland Protection Program focuses on 'land with prime, unique, or other productive soil.' The program will involve a maximum of $35 million, to be used for pur-chase of conservation easements on not less than 170,000 nor more than 340,000 acres (69,000-138,000 hectares) of vulnerable land.57&#13;
Another program focuses on conservation of private (that is, non-federal) grazing land, which makes up almost half of non-federal land in the US. Under the program, which will involve cooperation at the federal, state, and local levels, NRCS will provide technical and educational assistance to conserve and enhance private grazing resources. Preserving fish and wildlife habitat, improving water quality, and integrating conservation and management decisions are among the purposes of the program. Participation of landowners would be voluntary and not compensated.58&#13;
A program for flood risk reduction gives farmers with land that floods frequently an incentive to take that land out of production. Eligible farmers will receive no more than 95% of their projected contract payments, in exchange for terminating their production flexibility contracts, foregoing federal loans, and agreeing not to participate in other federal benefit programs.59&#13;
The Everglades Ecosystem Restoration Program authorizes $200 million through 1999 to help restore this valuable ecosystem in south Florida. Restoration activities can include acquisition of real property and interests in real property in the Everglades, and the funding of resource protection and maintenance activities.60 III. CONCLUSION&#13;
The conservation provisions of FAIR are only months old, and the statutory provisions themselves give only rather broad outlines of the new programs. More detail about im-plementation will come in regulations promulgated by USDA. Though some regulations must be issued quickly (e.g., 90 days for regulations for the Conservation and Wetlands Reserves), full implementation, particularly of totally new programs, will surely take longer. Moreover, some conservation programs will be hindered if Congress actually appropriates fewer dollars than FAIR authorizes. Federal spending reductions are likely to affect agricultural conservation.&#13;
To some extent, FAIR may result in more focused conservation on agricultural land. Under the Environmental Conservation Acreage Reserve, the emphasis on conservation priority areas will help to direct conservation dollars to land with special environmental sensitivity. Further, a new requirement for enrollment in the Wetlands Reserve is that the land must maximize 'wildlife benefits and wetland values and functions.' The Environmental Quality Incentives Program offers significant opportunity for environmental improvements through implementation of structural or land management practices. EQIP is intended to achieve the maximum environmental benefits for the money spent. Current concerns about the effect of livestock wastes are addressed by the requirement that 50% of annual EQIP appropriations go to practices relating to livestock production. The Conservation Farm Option will provide an opportunity to experiment with a program that pays for conservation adaptations of farm practices. The programs for wildlife habitat, purchase of conservation easements to protect farmland, and conservation of private grazing land are small beginnings that could provide lessons for future environmental efforts.&#13;
Though FAIR includes new programs for protecting the environment and statutory language that promises greater attention to conservation, some of its provisions may have the effect of weakening existing environmental protection. Early termination of CRP con-tracts is permitted and may result in a loss of conservation benefits on some land. In the sodbuster and swampbuster programs, the more generous good faith exemption gives producers who violate in good faith a year to comply, without loss of benefits. In addition, under sodbuster, a new focus on economie feasibility and a requirement that conservation systems avoid economie hardship add new factors to the environmental balance. Under swampbuster, the assignment of responsibility for wetlands technical determinations and development of restoration and mitigation plans to USDA, without mandatory consultation with the Secretary of the Interior or officials of the Fish and Wildlife Service, may streamline decisionmaking, but perhaps at some cost to wildlife interests. More exemptions from swampbuster requirements seem to allow farmers somewhat more latitude in farming wetlands areas.&#13;
The conservation provisions of 1996 Farm Bill are not the final step in the protection of the rural environment in the US. The continuation of the sodbuster and swampbuster requirements will protect highly erodible soil and wetlands. Like measures enacted under the agro-environmental regulation that accompanied the 1992 CAP reform,61 incentive-based conservation provisions offer new opportunities for farmers to conserve soil and protect water resources. Their success depends, in part, on the will of farmers to adapt their farming practices to the requirements of the environment. In the future, more environmental regulation of agriculture is likely to be implemented in the US. As a prominent agricultural economist noted recently:&#13;
Public attitudes have favored family farms with deferential treatment: federal cost-sharing, voluntary regulations, and tolerance towards soil and water degradation on individual farms. Public attitudes will be less solicitous toward industrialized farms and federal funds will be limited, hence more use will be made of mandatory, non-subsidized regulation of the environment. This setting . . . suggests that agriculture in the twenty-first century will practice better soil and water conservation than did agriculture in this century.62</content><legacyfootnotes>1. John C.
