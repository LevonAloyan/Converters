INTRODUCTION&#13;
American farmers have been troubled, particularly in recent years, by a frustrating&#13;
combination of rising debt levels, declining land values, and uncertain commodity&#13;
prices. The drought in many areas during Summer 1988 has meant increased&#13;
financial uncertainty, despite federal legislation that provides help to some farmers.1&#13;
Some American farmers have become insolvent and have sought protection from&#13;
the pressures of creditors. Unlike many other nations, the United States has bankruptcy&#13;
laws that allow individuals who are insolvent or who have significant debts&#13;
to receive a discharge from their debts under certain conditions.2 Although farmers&#13;
have long been the beneficiaries of special provisions, the federal Bankruptcy Code&#13;
as it existed until 1986 represented an inadequate lifeline for many farmers trying&#13;
to stay afloat in troubled times.&#13;
In 1986, the United States Congress passed a law titled 'Chapter 12 - Adjustment&#13;
of Debts of a Family Farmer with Regular Annual Income.'3 The new Chapter 12&#13;
provisions represent a significant change in the options available to American farmers&#13;
with excessive debt. Although other forms of bankruptcy continue to be&#13;
available to farmers, Chapter 12 offers a simplified and advantageous procedure.&#13;
This article will outline the provisions available to farmers prior to the enactment&#13;
of Chapter 12, and suggest some of the reasons those provisions were inadequate.&#13;
This article will also explore the options available to farmers under the new law, and&#13;
analyze the effects of the new provisions. </inleiding><content>B. FARM BANKRUPTCY ALTERNATIVES BEFORE CHAPTER 12&#13;
/. Chapter 7 - Liquidation&#13;
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code,4 the most basic of the bankruptcy alternatives,&#13;
provides for liquidation of the farm business,5 and represents the final recourse for&#13;
a farmer who can find no other relief from the claims of creditors. Any bankruptcy&#13;
proceeding can be initiated by the debtor, and Chapter 7 also usually allows&#13;
qualified creditors to initiate bankruptcy proceedings against a debtor when they&#13;
find it necessary to protect their interests. Farmers, however, receive special&#13;
treatment: they cannot be forced into bankruptcy involuntarily. To benefit from&#13;
this exception, the debtor must be a 'farmer' within a narrow statutory definition,&#13;
one requiring that at least 80 percent of the previous taxable year's gross income&#13;
result from a farming operation owned or operated by the debtor.6 Since the&#13;
passage of Chapter 12, a 'family farmer,' defined more broadly than 'farmer', is&#13;
also protected from involuntary bankruptcy.7&#13;
Under Chapter 7, the debtor is required to file a list of creditors and a schedule&#13;
of assets and liabilities with the bankruptcy court.8 The Code provides for a&#13;
trustee, whose primary responsibility is to distribute proceeds from the sale of the&#13;
farmer's property to creditors with allowed claims. The claims of secured creditors&#13;
(those whose claims are secured with collateral, for example by a mortgage on real&#13;
estate or a security interest in personal property) are satisfied (often with the&#13;
collateral itself) before those of unsecured creditors.&#13;
Once the distribution of assets has been completed, the farmer's remaining debts&#13;
will be discharged,9 with certain exceptions. One set of exceptions provides creditors&#13;
with the opportunity to object to discharge.10 Reasons for objecting to discharge&#13;
include a farmer's inadequate financial record-keeping or efforts to conceal&#13;
property. Furthermore, a debtor who has had his debts discharged within 6 years&#13;
prior to filing for Chapter 7 relief will not be granted another discharge. Some debts&#13;
may never be discharged. These include certain taxes, payments for child support or&#13;
maintenance of a spouse, and debts arising from certain types of liability in tort." 2. Chapter 11 - Reorganization&#13;
Many farmers who seek relief under the Bankruptcy Code would prefer to continue&#13;
farming rather than to liquidate their operations. For such farmers, particularly&#13;
those who entered bankruptcy prior to the effective date of Chapter 12, a&#13;
reorganization plan under Chapter 11 provides a more suitable, although expensive&#13;
and complex, option.12 Furthermore, a farmer who begins liquidation proceedings&#13;
under Chapter 7 can convert his bankruptcy case to Chapter 11, 12 or 13.13&#13;
Chapter 11 debtors, like Chapter 7 debtors, can usually be forced into bankruptcy&#13;
by creditors, but those who meet the statutory definition of 'farmer'14 or 'family&#13;
farmer'15 are protected from involuntary bankruptcy.16&#13;
The heart of a Chapter 11 reorganization is a plan, usually designed by the farmer&#13;
with input from interested creditors, with the goal of fulfilling some or all of the&#13;
farmer's financial obligations. Unlike Chapter 7, a Chapter 11 proceeding need not&#13;
involve the appointment of a trustee. Instead, the debtor remains in control of the&#13;
business, and is referred to as a 'debtor in possession."7 The farmer continues to&#13;
operate, but under the constraints of the plan, which governs the operation of the&#13;
farming business and imposes a payment plan for a number of years.&#13;
Some creditors may receive less than full satisfaction of their claims (or receive&#13;
payment over a longer term than originally agreed) under the plan; they may, under&#13;
some circumstances, protest the plan. Although creditors can be forced to accept&#13;
a plan to which they object, all creditors are entitled to receive at least as much as&#13;
they would have received if the farmer had chosen a Chapter 7 liquidation.18&#13;
Between the time the farmer files Chapter 11 and the court approves a plan, the&#13;
farmer needs protection from aggressive creditors, who might otherwise move&#13;
swiftly to collect on secured debts, thereby endangering any possibility of continuing&#13;
to farm. The Bankruptcy Code provides this protection. The Code imposes an&#13;
'automatic stay' on efforts of creditors to collect on secured (and other) debts; this&#13;
stay takes effect as soon as the farmer has filed a bankruptcy petition.19 In addition,&#13;
the Code authorizes the farmer to continue using secured assets and 'cash collateral'&#13;
in the ordinary course of business.20 The farmer is also allowed to obtain&#13;
unsecured credit in the ordinary course of business - an important concession to&#13;
a farmer who may need money to plant or harvest. Special provisions help ensure&#13;
repayment to these new creditors.21 During the period before confirmation of the plan, while the farmer is protected&#13;
by the automatic stay, secured creditors are naturally concerned with the status of&#13;
assets affected by the stay. In the case of both real estate and other farm assets, the&#13;
automatic stay may prevent a creditor from seizing or foreclosing on property whose&#13;
value is steadily declining. In this situation, the interests of secured creditors are&#13;
preserved to a great extent by 'adequate protection' provisions. These provisions&#13;
ensure that creditors receive some alternative equivalent (such as additional liens or&#13;
cash payments) of their interest in property affected by the stay.22&#13;
As soon as the bankruptcy court confirms the plan of reorganization, both farmer&#13;
and creditors are bound by its provisions. The farmer's legal obligation is to fulfill&#13;
the conditions of the plan; confirmation of the plan acts to discharge the debtor&#13;
from debts that arose prior to confirmation.&#13;
3. Chapter 13 - Adjustment of debts ofan individual with regular income&#13;
Chapter 13 applies to individuals (not corporations or partnerships) with regular&#13;
income. It offers significant advantages over Chapter 11 for those who qualify: it&#13;
is less expensive and less complex. Chapter 13 is exclusively debtor-initiated;&#13;
creditors can never force a debtor into Chapter 13. Like Chapter 11, Chapter 13&#13;
requires a plan of reorganization, but creditors play no role in filing a Chapter 13&#13;
plan.&#13;
To ensure that creditor action will not prevent successful reorganization, the&#13;
automatic stay provisions apply in Chapter 13, as in Chapter 11.23 Chapter 13&#13;
creditors are entitled to adequate protection, defined in the same terms as under&#13;
Chapter 11.24 The Chapter 13 plan must be approved by the court. To receive&#13;
approval, the plan must provide for the payment of all claims in f uil or provide that&#13;
the debtor's disposable income for a period of three years following his initial&#13;
payment must be used for payments under the plan.25 'Disposable income' is any&#13;
income not needed to support the debtor and his or her dependents or to maintain&#13;
operation of the business.26 Discharge of debts under Chapter 13 occurs only after the farmer has completed payments under the plan, and only after the court approves&#13;
the discharge.27&#13;
While the simplicity of Chapter 13 might appear particularly attractive, the debt&#13;
limits imposed make Chapter 13 unavailable to many financially troubled farmers.&#13;
Chapter 13 applies only to those individuals (or married couples) with unsecured&#13;
debts of less than $100,000 and secured debts of less than $35O,OOO.28 Many farmers&#13;
owe f ar more to their creditors.&#13;
C. BANKRUPTCY FOR THE 'FAMILY FARMER'&#13;
/. Chapter 12 - Adjustment of debts of afamily farmer with regular annual income&#13;
Congress enacted Chapter 12, which is effective only until 1993,29 to provide a&#13;
simple bankruptcy procedure for financially distressed family farmers. It is similar&#13;
to Chapter 13, but with a liberalized source-of-income requirement for qualification&#13;
and without such restrictive debt limitations. To qualify as a 'family farmer,' an&#13;
individual or a married couple (or a family-run corporation or partnership) must&#13;
receive more than 50 percent of annual income from farming operations owned or&#13;
operated by them.30 This 50 percent provision makes Chapter 12 available even&#13;
to many farm families who have relied on significant off-farm employment to&#13;
compensate for lack of farm earnings. Furthermore, the debt limitations under&#13;
Chapter 12 make it much more accessible. The farmer may qualify with up to&#13;
$1,500,000 in total debts, so long as at least 80 percent of the debt (excluding debt&#13;
for a principal residence) arises from farming operations.31&#13;
As with Chapters 11 and 13, the automatic stay gives the Chapter 12 debtor&#13;
protection from creditors who might want to seize or foreclose on secured&#13;
property.32 The debtor also has the opportunity to use secured assets to operate the&#13;
farm business. Chapter 12 creditors are once again granted 'adequate protection,'&#13;
but under a new definition.33 The new adequate protection language provides&#13;
limited protection to the secured creditor, who under some Chapter 11 cases had been held entitled to compensation for 'lost opportunity' costs connected with the&#13;
assets (usually land) involved.34 The more open-ended language in Chapter 12&#13;
protects only the value of the collateral, not the lost opportunity costs associated&#13;
with the collateral.35&#13;
The debtor must file a plan within 90 days after filing the initial petition in court,&#13;
although the court may allow extra time if such an extension can be justified.36&#13;
Creditors have no right to file a plan under Chapter 12. If the plan filed by the&#13;
debtor fails to satisfy the holders of certain unsecured debts (who are, in any event,&#13;
entitled to at least what they would have received under a Chapter 7 liquidation),&#13;
those creditors may prevent court confirmation uniess the plan requires the debtor&#13;
to submit all of his disposable income37 to make payments for the duration of the&#13;
plan. Before confirming a plan, the court must make a determination that the&#13;
farmer will be able to comply with its terms.38 The plan may last up to three years,&#13;
or as long as five years if the court 'for cause' approves a longer period.&#13;
Once the plan is confirmed by the court, it binds both debtor and creditors. Under&#13;
a Chapter 12 plan, the debtor is allowed to continue farming operations; nonetheless,&#13;
a trustee is appointed by the court. The Chapter 12 plan will require that a sufficient&#13;
portion of the debtor's income be placed under the control of the trustee to be&#13;
disbursed in accordance with the plan.39 The trustee's responsibilities include overseeing&#13;
this implementation of the plan, as well as filing a final report and accounting&#13;
at the plan's conclusion. After the debtor has completed all payments under the&#13;
plan, the remaining unsecured debts are discharged,40 except for a few nondischargeable&#13;
debts.41&#13;
2. The use of Chapter 12&#13;
The Chapter 12 provisions took effect in late 1986 to deal with a financial crisis in&#13;
agriculture and will lapse in 1993 uniess Congress takes further action.42 The&#13;
ultimate effect of this new legislation is not yet clear. Nonetheless, a significant&#13;
number of farmers have filed Chapter 12 petitions. In twelve states in the north central region of the United States, for example, almost 3600 cases had been filed&#13;
by 31 January 1988.43 Moreover, in the first twenty months of effectiveness of&#13;
Chapter 12, more than 250 court opinions had been published.44 This extensive use&#13;
of Chapter 12 suggests that financially troubled farmers find the Chapter 12&#13;
provisions preferable to the other bankruptcy alternatives.&#13;
As farmers have begun to use Chapter 12 to reorganize their operations, however,&#13;
a number of issues have arisen. Some important questions concern who can qualify&#13;
as a family farmer. These issues arise in the context of what constitutes a 'farming&#13;
operation' (because, to be eligible, at least 50 percent of the debtor's income from&#13;
the past year and 80 percent of the debtor's debt must be from farming operations),&#13;
and which debts are to be included in computing debt levels (because of the $1.5&#13;
million maximum).45 Other difficult issues focus on compensation of Chapter 12&#13;
trustees, the feasibility of proposed plans, the identification of creditors who are&#13;
entitled to adequate protection and what constitutes adequate protection, and the&#13;
appropriate rate of interest for creditors under a Chapter 12 plan.&#13;
This new bankruptcy alternative for family farmers is sure to benefit at least&#13;
some farmers whose solvency has been threatened by the farm economy or other&#13;
difficulties. Indeed, the availability of its favorable provisions has improved the&#13;
farmer's ability to negotiate with creditors. Some creditors have become more&#13;
willing to restructure debts in out-of-court settlements. Other recent developments,&#13;
however, have also affected the relationship between farmer and creditors. For&#13;
example, the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 requires the restructuring of distressed&#13;
loans by certain Farm Credit System lenders.46 In addition, some states now&#13;
require mediation between certain farm borrowers and their creditors.47 Restructuring&#13;
or mediation may allow some farmers to avoid bankruptcy entirely.&#13;
Chapter 12 alters the relationship between farmers and their creditors for the&#13;
benefit of farmer debtors. In the long run, however, a new bankruptcy procedure can&#13;
only help farmers to survive the present crisis. It does not improve conditions in the&#13;
farm economy. When real estate and farm commodity prices will allow family farms&#13;
to survive in a stable environment is a question that only the future will answer.</content><legacyfootnotes>1. Disaster Assistance Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-387, 102 Stat. 924 (1988). This Act was signed by&#13;

3. 11 U.S.C.A. §§ 1201-1231. The complex Bankruptcy Code is divided into chapters. Chapters 1, 3, and&#13;
5 include general provisions that apply in all bankruptcies, and other chapters govern the different types&#13;
of bankruptcy. Each of the various types of bankruptcy is identified by referring to the number of the&#13;
chapter that includes governing provisions for that type of bankruptcy.&#13;
4. 11 U.S.C.A. §§ 701-766.&#13;
5. Chapter 7, like Chapters 11 and 13, applies to nonfarm debtors as well as farmers. The emphasis here,&#13;
however, is the application of those chapters to farmers. Chapter 12, on the other hand, applies only&#13;
to family farmers. 6. 11 U.S.C.A. § 101(19). 'Farming operation' includes 'farming, tillage of the soil, dairy farming,&#13;
ranching, production or raising of crops, poultry, or livestock, and production of poultry or livestock&#13;
products in an unmanufactured state.' 11 U.S.C.A. § 101(20).&#13;

8. The bankruptcy court is a specialized federal court that is a unit of the district court in each judicial&#13;
district. The bankruptcy judge is a judicial officer of the district court. Appeals from final bankruptcy&#13;
court judgments are normally heard in the district courts, from which appeal is taken to the U.S. courts&#13;
of appeals.&#13;

19. 11 U.S.C.A. § 362. The automatic stay provisions are not unique to Chapter 11, but they are&#13;
especially important to a debtor who wants to reorganize.&#13;
20. 11 U.S.C.A. § 363. 'Cash collateral' is defined as 'cash, negotiable instruments, documents of title,&#13;
securities, deposit accounts, or other cash equivalents... in which the [debtor's] estate and an entity other&#13;
than the estate have an interest ..." 11 U.S.C.A. § 363(a).&#13;
21. 11 U.S.C.A. § 364.&#13;
22. 11 U.S.CA. § 361. Adequate protection is designed to compensate for any diminution in value of&#13;
the secured assets. In addition to cash payments or additional liens, compensation can take the form of&#13;
other relief that assures the creditor of the 'indubitable equivalent' of his interest in the property.&#13;
The adequate protection provisions, according to the legislative history, are based on the protections&#13;
of property interests inherent in the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment, which prohibits the&#13;
government from taking property without providing just compensation. Furthermore, adequate&#13;
protection furthers the policy objective of protecting the rights of creditors to receive 'the benefit of their&#13;
bargain.' H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., lst Sess. 338-39 (1977).&#13;
23. While Chapter 13, like Chapter 11, protects the debtor whose creditors are attempting to collect in&#13;
their claims, Chapter 13 has the added advantage of a stay of action of creditors to collect consumer debt&#13;
from a codebtor. 11 U.S.CA. § 1301. This stay of action against a codebtor was designed to insulate&#13;
the debtor from 'indirect pressures from his creditors exerted through friends or relatives that may have&#13;
cosigned an obligation of the debtor.' H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., lst Sess. 426 (1977)&#13;
24. See supra note 22.&#13;
25. 11 U.S.CA. § 1325(b)(l)(B). Court approval is needed if a trustee or unsecured claimant objects to&#13;
confirmation of the plan.&#13;
26. 11 U.S.C.A. § 1325(b)(2).&#13;
27. 11 U.S.CA. § 1328. In certain circumstances, the court is also permitted to grant a discharge to a&#13;
debtor who has not successfully completed all payments under the plan. 11 U.S.CA. § 1328(b).&#13;
28. 11 U.S.CA. § 109(e). These limits include only noncontingent, liquidated debts (those obligations&#13;
that are presently fixed and certain).&#13;
29. Bankruptcy Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986, Pub. L.&#13;
No. 99-554, § 302(0- Congress has the power to extend the applicability of Chapter 12 beyond 1993.&#13;
30. 11 U.S.CA. § 101(17)(A). See Kershen, Chapter 12 and debts arising from a farming operation,&#13;
Agricultural Law Update (June 1988).&#13;
31. 11 U.S.C.A. § 101(17)(A), (B)(ii).&#13;
32. Chapter 12, like Chapter 13, includes the stay of action against codebtors described in note 23, supra.&#13;
11 U.S.C.A. § 1201.&#13;
33. As with the other chapters, 'adequate protection' may take the form of cash payments or additional&#13;
liens to protect the creditor against declining asset values. The Chapter 12 provisions also allow the&#13;
debtor to pay a mortgagee of farmland 'the reasonable rent customary in the community' as a form of&#13;
protection. 11 U.S.C.A. § 1205(b)(3).&#13;
Chapter 12 allows for other forms of relief as well, but unlike under Chapters 11 and 13, the Chapter&#13;
12 creditor need not be assured the 'indubitable equivalent' of his interest in the property. Instead, the&#13;
statute calls for 'other relief ... as will adequately protect the value of property securing a claim or of&#13;
[the creditor's] ownership interest in property.' 11 U.S.C.A. § 1205(b)(4).&#13;
34. A number of courts have faced this issue in Chapter 11. Finally, however, in United Sav. Ass'n. v.&#13;
Timbers of Inwood Forest Assocs., 108 S. Ct. 626 (1988), the United States Supreme Court unanimously&#13;
upheld a decision by the 5th Circuit, 808 F.2d 363 (1987), denying lost opportunity costs to an undersecured&#13;
creditor who sought damages based on delay in the ability to foreclose.&#13;
35. See, e.g. In re Raylyn Ag, Inc., 72 Bankr. 523 (Bankr. S.D. Iowa 1987).&#13;
36. 11 U.S.CA. § 1221. This compares favorably (for the farmer) to the 15-day provision in Chapter&#13;
13. In Chapter 11, the debtor has the exclusive right to file a plan for 120 days, after which creditors&#13;
may have the right to file their own plan. See Bankruptcy Rule 3015 and 11 U.S.CA. § 1121.&#13;
37. See supra text accompanying note 24.&#13;
38. 11 U.S.CA. § 1225(a)(b). The plan must be feasible, a Standard that requires a reasonable probability&#13;
of success, rather than guaranteed success.&#13;

42. See supra text accompanying note 31 for a description of the allowable debt in a Chapter 12&#13;
case.&#13;
43. The legislative history indicates that 'Congress will want to evaluate both whether the chapter is&#13;
serving its purpose and whether there is a continuing need for a special chapter for the family farmer.&#13;
When it makes this evaluation, Congress will be able to determine whether or not to make this chapter&#13;
permanent.' H.R. Rep. No. 958, 99th Cong., 2nd Sess. 48 (1986).&#13;
