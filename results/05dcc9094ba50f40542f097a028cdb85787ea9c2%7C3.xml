Legal rules help to ensure that rural land remains available for its significant functions and that the rural environment is protected for ag­ricultural and other activities.&#13;
This Article focuses on rural land in the US. After a brief in­troduction that provides helpful background, the Article con­siders several issues that affect the use of rural land: land use planning, farm tenancy, and environmental regulation. The Article then turns to issues connected with rural devel­opment: federal programs for rural development, tourism on rural land, and forestry. Finally, with a focus on conser­vation, the Article considers governmental authority to take agricultural land for protected nature areas and government financial incentives for activities that preserve the productiv­ity of agricultural land and protect the environment.1&#13;

1.1 Agricultural Land Use in the United States&#13;
Much of the total land area in the US is used for agricultur­al purposes, and agricultural production adds significant val­ue to the US economy. The US has a total land area of about 2.3 billion acres (1 hectare is 2.469 acres); more than 60% of US land (and 99% of cropland) is privately owned.2 In the 48 contiguous states (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), with about 1.9 billion acres, the federal government owns 402 million acres. Almost 1.4 billion acres are nonfederal rural land: rangeland (409 million acres), pasture (119 mil­lion), forest (406 million), and cropland (357 million, in­cluding 324 million acres of prime farmland). Urban uses occupy only a small percentage of total US land.3&#13;
For purposes of the 2010 census, the US Census Bureau de­fined a rural area as ‘all population, housing, and territo­ry not included within an urban area.’4 Urban land included ‘urbanized areas’ with 50,000 or more people, as well as ‘ur­ban clusters’ with at least 2,500 and fewer than 50,000 peo­ple. Despite this broad definition of rural land, not all rural areas are considered farms.&#13;
For statistical purposes, USDA and the Census Bureau de­fine ‘farm’ broadly as any place which produces or sells (or normally would produce or sell) $1,000 of agricultural prod­ucts.5 The 2007 Census of Agriculture estimated that the US has 2.2 million farms. Land in farms is 922 million acres, with an average farm size of 418 acres. The majority of US farms are small, both in size and in value of sales. About 1.7 million farms have sales of less than $50,000, and 1.5 mil­lion are smaller than 180 acres. In contrast, about 116,000 farms have sales over $500,000, and 173,000 are larger than 1000 acres.6&#13;
Further analysis by USDA focuses on total gross sales from farms. Small family farms have yearly sales of less than $250,000. They make up 88% of US farms and hold 63% of land in farms, but produce only 16% of total agricultur­al output.7 By contrast, large family farms, with yearly sales over $250,000, make up only 9% of farms and hold 30% of U.S farmland, but produce over 65% of total agricultur­al output.8 Non-family farms account for only 2% of farms, 7% of land in farms, and about 18% of production.9&#13;
According to the US Census Bureau, the value of agricul­tural sector production in 2008 was $364.9 billion. The val­ue of crop production was $182.5 billion; livestock pro­duction, $139.7 billion; services and forestry, $42.6 billion. After various expenses, gross value added to the economy from agriculture was $164.4 billion, and net farm income was $87.1 billion.10&#13;
1.2 Constitutional and Administrative Protections&#13;
Though the United States developed as an agrarian nation, with deep respect for the value and virtues of farmers,11 the US Constitution has no special provisions for agriculture. Indeed, the words ‘agriculture’ and ‘farmer’ do not appear in the Constitution or its Amendments. Farmers, of course, en­joy the same constitutional protections as other citizens.&#13;
Similarly, the complex judicial system in the US gives no preference to agriculture. Both federal and state courts de­cide cases and hear appeals. Jurisdiction of federal courts is limited mainly to cases that raise federal questions (that is, ‘civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States’12) and cases between parties with di­versity of citizenship.13 State courts (in 50 states) have gen­eral jurisdiction, and state law often governs issues of land use. Agricultural disputes, like other cases, are heard in the appropriate federal or state trial court. With a few excep­tions, courts do not normally specialize in agricultural or other areas.14&#13;
Administrative tribunals play a role in resolving some ag­ricultural issues, particularly disputes connected with pro­grams authorized by US agricultural legislation. For exam­ple, parties who receive an adverse decision from an agency in the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) have the right to appeal to the USDA’s National Appeals Division. Federal district courts hear appeals of final NAD determinations.15&#13;
2. Rural Land&#13;
2.1 Land Use Planning&#13;
Land use planning in the US depends in part on ownership of land. The federal government owns almost 30% of the land in the United States, especially in the western states and in Alaska. Four agencies - the Bureau of Land Manage­ment (Department of the Interior), the US Forest Service (USDA), Fish and Wildlife Service (DoI) and the Nation­al Park Service (DoI) - manage the majority of federal land. Statutes impose specific planning and management require­ments, tailored to the function of the lands, for these agen­cies.16 Federal land use plans govern the use and develop­ment of this federal land. Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act,17 for example, land use plans for federal land must take into account ‘principles of multiple use and sustained yield,’ protection of environmentally sensitive are­as, potential public uses of the land, and scarcity of resourc­es, among other factors.18&#13;
For privately-owned land, both urban and rural, local gov­ernments usually govern land use. States have authority to govern land use under the ‘police power,’ the authority to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of citi­zens. A few states have enacted state-wide land use plan­ning laws, and comprehensive state land use plans impose requirements (sometimes including preservation of agricul­tural land) for local government planning. Most states, how­ever, delegate zoning authority to local governments - that is, counties and municipalities, which enact ordinances for their own jurisdictions. Zoning is often based on a compre­hensive land use plan that articulates the community’s vision and goals for future growth and development. In accordance with that plan, a zoning map identifies land use districts and defines uses and density permitted in each district.19 The process of adoption of zoning ordinances provides public notice and the opportunity for interested citizens to make their views heard.&#13;
Some jurisdictions limit the power of zoning officials to re­strict agricultural activities. In Illinois, for example, coun­ty zoning authority may not be exercised to ‘impose regu­lations, eliminate uses, buildings, or structures, or require permits with respect to land used for agricultural purpos­es.’20 Counties may require agricultural buildings and struc­tures to comply with building or set-back lines. Other states have similar provisions.21 A few states also protect some ac­tivities related to agriculture from zoning restrictions. For example, Massachusetts limits regulation of agricultural ac­tivities, ‘including those facilities for the sale of produce, wine and dairy products’ under certain conditions.22&#13;
In contrast to many European countries, the majority of ru­ral land, including agricultural land, is not zoned. Nonethe­less, some jurisdictions have enacted agricultural protection zoning to restrict land uses, particularly activities incompati­ble with agriculture, in agricultural zones. Several approach­es exist: exclusive agricultural zoning, which prevents de­velopment of agricultural land; area-based zoning, which sets density restrictions; cluster zoning, which governs den­sity, but allows development on a small parcel; and mini­mum lot size zoning.23&#13;
Areas protected for agriculture can be identified in sever­al ways. For example, the state statute that authorizes zoning may define agriculture, possibly in the context of limiting zoning authority over agricultural land.24 A comprehen­sive zoning plan may identify factors that determine wheth­er land should be reserved for agricultural use. These factors vary among jurisdictions, but might include the suitability of the soil for agriculture, the presence of existing agricultural uses, the presence of open land that is free from conflicting land uses, and the need to protect agricultural uses by pre­venting non-farm activities.25 Statutes may establish other means of identifying agricultural areas for protection.26&#13;
In light of climate change and other environmental prob­lems, state and local governments have begun to emphasize sustainability. Therefore, some states have amended stat­utes that delegate zoning authority to counties and munici­palities. These amendments require or encourage local gov­ernments to foster sustainability in their comprehensive land use plans and to adopt sustainable planning techniques. For example, some states require that comprehensive plans in­corporate renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power, consider conservation elements to account for the ef­fect of land development on natural resources and public lands, or encourage energy-efficient land use patterns and prevent sprawl. Some states, however, impose these require­ments only on heavily-populated cities and counties, effec­tively exempting more sparsely-populated rural areas from sustainable planning requirements.27&#13;
2.2 Farm Tenancy&#13;
The 2007 Census of Agriculture indicated that full own­ers farmed 69% of farms; part owners, 24.5%; and full ten­ants, 6.4%. Part owners, who rent some land, operated the largest farms, with an average size of 915 acres; full tenants had farms with an average size of 582 acres, and full own­ers, only 226 acres.28 Rented land (about 38% of total land in farms) is thus critical for US agriculture, particularly for larger grain and oilseed operations.&#13;
Farm leases, which convey a possessory interest to the ten­ant, are governed primarily by private law - that is, by con­tract. Common-law principles and state statutes, which re­flect the practical requirements of farming, govern some issues to protect both landlord and tenant. For example, state statutes establish a landlord’s lien on crops to secure pay­ment of rent and require timely notice of termination for some types of leases.29&#13;
Generally, landlords and tenants are free to structure leases by contract; no government agency controls rent, duration, or other lease terms. One-year leases are common, and ei­ther party is free to terminate the lease at the end of the lease term. In practice, however, landlord-tenant relationships of­ten last for many years. Though written leases provide more certainty, some farm leases are oral. Written leases normally require the tenant to practice ‘good husbandry’ and may im­pose environmental conditions stricter than normal require­ments of good husbandry. Even without a specific provision in the lease, the common law requires good husbandry, and a lease can be terminated for failure to apply good agricul­tural practices.30&#13;
The existence of a lease may affect the tenant’s ability to participate in various federal farm programs, including con­servation programs. The lease itself may address the issue. For example, a crop-share lease form used in Illinois states that ‘Lessor and Tenant shall decide each year whether to enter into governmental programs designed to aid agricul­ture and how payments for doing so and the cost involved shall be shared between them.’31 Moreover, federal regu­lations that govern conservation programs impose protec­tive requirements. For example, enrollment of rented land in the Conservation Reserve Program, discussed below, re­quires signatures of both landowner and tenant, and regula­tions require an equitable division of payments.32 Operators of farms, including tenants, are eligible to enter contracts under the Conservation Stewardship Program and the Envi­ronmental Quality Incentives Program.33 Tenants with short-term leases may have little incentive to adopt conservation practices that offer only long-term rewards.&#13;
2.3 Environmental Restrictions&#13;
Agriculture is vulnerable to pollution and environmental degradation, because farming depends on soil, water, and air for production of crops and livestock. But emissions from agriculture, especially from intensive production, are a sig­nificant source of pollution. Nutrients and chemicals from crop production and wastes from livestock operations reach surface and ground waters, and intensive livestock produc­tion results in emission of regulated air pollutants and odors.&#13;
Though the polluter pays principle suggests that agricul­ture should be subject to environmental regulation like oth­er industries,34 the US has exempted agriculture from some environmental regulation.35 Under the Clean Water Act (CWA),36 for example, many emissions from agriculture (e.g., from cropland and grazing livestock) are considered nonpoint pollution, which is subject to little direct regula­tion. Instead, the CWA requires state assessment, disclosure, and management programs for nonpoint pollution, but im­poses no federal requirements.37 A few states have enact­ed mandatory measures to limit erosion, but most states of­fer incentives to encourage best management practices. Both the USDA and the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have identified best management practices to prevent nonpoint source pollution.38&#13;
Point sources of water pollution require permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.39 The CWA defines concentrated animal feeding operations as point sources of pollution; large operations must comply with effluent limitation guidelines, but relatively few live­stock facilities actually require permits under provisions of EPA regulations.40 Moreover, in connection with ara­ble farming, ‘agricultural stormwater discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture’ are excluded from the CWA definition of point sources and do not require permits.41&#13;
Air emissions from animal feeding operations come from animal confinement buildings, manure storage facilities, and land application of waste; they include particulate mat­ter, gases (including greenhouse gases), vapors, and odors. Though air emissions from livestock facilities include sever­al pollutants (e.g., ammonia) regulated by the federal Clean Air Act (CAA),42 few facilities have been required to obtain operating permits.43 Calculating air emissions from live­stock facilities is difficult. Recent research, pursuant to a voluntary Air Compliance Agreement with livestock produc­ers, may result in more accurate estimation of emissions and facilitate identification of livestock facilities that must ob­tain operating permits.44&#13;
These examples indicate that US environmental laws of­ten exclude agriculture from requirements that apply to oth­er industries. Instead, both the federal government and states rely on incentives to encourage good environmental prac­tices. Public recognition of the environmental effects of in­tensive agricultural production, however, may lead to strict­er regulation.&#13;
3. Rural Development and Related Issues&#13;
3.1 Rural Development&#13;
Rural development has long played an important role in the US. The commitment to rural development began in the 1930s and continues today. Indeed, in USDA’s Strategic Plan for 2010-2015, the first strategic goal is to ‘assist rural communities to create prosperity so they are self-sustaining, repopulating, and economically thriving.’45 Objectives con­nected with this strategic goal are to enhance rural prosperi­ty (with broadband access, renewable energy, regional food systems, ecosystem markets, and green jobs), to create thriv­ing communities, and to ‘support a sustainable and competi­tive agricultural system.’46&#13;
In June 2011, President Obama established a cabinet-level White House Rural Council. His executive order rec­ognized that 16% of the US population lives in rural coun­ties and that these counties experience serious challenges but offer potential for economic growth. The White House Rural Council, chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture and supported by USDA, will ‘coordinate development of policy recommendations to promote economic prosperity and qual­ity of life in rural America.’47 The Council will coordinate federal programs in rural areas and facilitate cooperation with rural stakeholders, agricultural organizations, small businesses, and governments. The Council’s focus will be ‘key factors for growth,’ with emphasis on jobs, expanding markets for agriculture, ecosystem markets, access to credit, healthcare, education, infrastructure, and technology.48&#13;
USDA is the lead agency for rural development in the US, but other federal agencies also play a role, particularly in ru­ral economic development. USDA administers more than half of the 88 federal programs for rural development.49 Au­thorized by several statutes and implemented through nu­merous regulations,50 USDA rural development programs are an important, but complicated, component of nation­al policy to support the economic viability of rural areas. These programs are designed as a ‘‘venture capitalist for ru­ral America’ … [providing] ‘equity, liquidity and techni­cal assistance to finance and foster growth’ and preserve ru­ral communities.’51 The various programs offer loans and grants for businesses, cooperatives, single and multi-family housing, community facilities, electricity, water and sewer facilities, telecommunications, and community and econom­ic development.52 To foster sustainable industries, USDA programs also support the development of alternative and renewable energy in rural areas.53 Each rural development program has criteria for eligibility. Population limits for the various programs range from 2,500 to 50,000 inhabitants, and other requirements apply.54&#13;
3.2 Tourism&#13;
Natural areas attract tourists, and federal land includes both national parks and wilderness areas. US national parks re­flect the difficult balance between tourism and conservation. The many visitors create pressure on park resources, and en­vironmental degradation or damage may result.55 The Na­tional Park Service (NPS),56 which manages the parks, fol­lows a dual mandate: to promote current use and enjoyment of parks and to conserve and manage parks for the enjoy­ment of future generations.57&#13;
The NPS sets general policies for park management. To pro­tect parks over the long term, these policies emphasize land protection, management of natural and cultural resources, and wilderness preservation and management. To facilitate current use, policies govern interpretation and education, use of parks, management of facilities, and services for visi­tors.58 In addition, the NPS develops management plans for each national park.59 These plans impose measures to pre­serve resources and to accommodate visitors; they may also regulate activities that threaten environmental harm to the park (e.g., use of snowmobiles or off-road vehicles).60&#13;
Concessions and permits allow private businesses to provide public services, accommodations, and facilities within na­tional parks. In granting concessions, the NPS must balance economically beneficial uses with preservation of the parks’ natural beauty. The agency must limit public uses to those that are ‘necessary and appropriate’ and that are highly con­sistent with ‘preservation and conservation of resources.’ 61 The NPS awards permits to concession providers based on their ability to meet the goal of conserving park resources while providing necessary services to the public at reasona­ble rates.62&#13;
On private land, agritourism has become an important means of agricultural diversification, as it ‘links agricultur­al production with opportunities for recreation, education, or entertainment.’63 Many agritourism activities focus on out­door recreation (including hunting, fishing, and horseback riding) and hospitality (bed and breakfast, visits to ranch­es).64 Agritourism supplements farm income, generates eco­nomic activity for rural communities, and protects farmland and natural amenities, but it may overtax local facilities and stress wildlife.65 Laws in more than 20 states promote or facilitate agritourism.66 Though many laws provide govern­mental or financial support, a few mitigate liability, an im­portant concern for agritourism enterprises, especially for injuries to participants.67&#13;
3.3 Forestry&#13;
In the US, forests offer both natural beauty and econom­ic value. Land used for forests makes up almost 29% of to­tal US land area, and much of this forest is timberland. For­ests serve numerous other purposes, which include grazing, recreation, and special uses such as parks and wildlife are­as. Only about one-third of US forests are federally owned.68&#13;
Many US forests are privately owned, and a number of fed­eral programs offer assistance and economic incentives to owners who agree to follow prescribed forestry management and conservation standards.69 The USDA Strategic Plan for 2010-2015 identified conservation of forests as an impor­tant goal,70 and in June 2011, USDA announced its Stra­tegic Framework to promote agroforestry - the intentional combination of ‘agriculture and forestry to create integrat­ed and sustainable land-use systems that take advantage of the interactive benefits from combining trees and shrubs with crops and/or livestock.’71 With the cooperation of five USDA agencies, state foresters, and conservation districts, activities to implement the framework will help to increase agroforestry, integrate agroforestry into conservation and economic development, and advance the science of agrofor­estry.72&#13;
Forest land owned by the US offers both natural and eco­nomic values. In 1897, Congress authorized establishment of national forests to ‘improve and protect the forest … and to furnish a continuous supply of timber for the use and ne­cessities of citizens.’73 Timber harvesting is the primary economic use of these forests, and the National Forest Man­agement Act (NFMA) balances logging with natural val­ues.74 Under the NFMA, the Forest Service must manage forests according to the principle of ‘multiple use and sus­tained yield.’75 The NFMA restricts some logging methods (e.g., clearcutting) and requires the Forest Service to protect plant, wildlife, and water resources, ‘based on the suitabili­ty and capability of the specific land area.’76 To this end, the Forest Service prepares management plans that identify for­est management areas and assign priorities, including timber harvesting, recreation, and habitat and wildlife conservation, for each management area.77&#13;
The Endangered Species Act (ESA)78 applies in forests, as well as on other land. The ESA prohibits the taking of en­dangered species and requires the federal government (and private landowners) to identify and protect the critical hab­itat of those species.79 Parties may not undertake actions within critical habitat - for example, harvesting trees that harbor endangered species - that will take or harm the spe­cies by destroying habitat.80 The US Supreme Court had in­terpreted the ESA to require the government to protect en­dangered species and their habitats, ‘whatever the cost.’81 Congress amended the ESA, however, to allow considera­tion of economic as well as wildlife conservation interests in designation of critical habitat.82 Now the US Fish and Wild­life Service, which administers the ESA, may consider the economic impact of a critical habitat designation and per­form a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether an area should be included or excluded from critical habitat. As a re­sult, US forests, like other land that harbors endangered spe­cies, are governed by a balance between economic interests and natural values.&#13;
US policy for wildfires focuses mainly on suppression and management of forest fires. For example, the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003,83 a response to extensive for­est fires in the western part of the US, authorizes actions to prevent future forest fires. These include measures to clear hazardous brush and undergrowth that could fuel fires on federal land and to control insects that make forests more vulnerable to fire.84 The Act also establishes a healthy for­est reserve program, to enroll up to 2 million acres of private land under contract and subject to a restoration plan. The re­serve is intended to restore or enhance habitat for endan­gered, threatened or other vulnerable species.85 The Collab­orative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, authorized in 2009, focuses on ecological restoration of national for­ests, but also encourages measures to reduce costs of wild­fire management.86&#13;
Agencies with authority over specific forest or wilderness areas usually prescribe measures to prevent wildfire and to restore burned areas. Site-specific legislation sometimes governs the application of fire management and suppression measures,87 giving an agency (e.g., the Forest Service) au­thority to implement measures necessary to prevent and to control wildfires in national forests and other vulnerable ar­eas. Federal agencies have also begun to incorporate ele­ments for managing wildfires into their resource manage­ment and land use plans for specific areas.88&#13;
4. Conservation on Rural Land&#13;
In the US as in other nations. rural areas often harbor the most valuable - and vulnerable - natural areas. Some rural land is dedicated to the conservation of nature, while oth­er land produces food and fiber. As the following discussion indicates, governmental units may take agricultural land for nature conservation purposes. More often, however, agricul­tural landowners and producers may receive incentives for activities that conserve their farmland and protect the envi­ronment.&#13;
4.1 Rural Land for Nature Conservation&#13;
In the US, many nature conservation areas exist on pub­lic land. National parks and wildlife areas, for example, are located on federal land; states also own parks and oth­er natural areas. A government agency that plans to devel­op additional nature conservation areas usually has author­ity to acquire agricultural or other rural land for the project through the exercise of eminent domain.&#13;
Under the US Constitution, governments may exercise the power of eminent domain to take privately-owned land, in­cluding agricultural and rural land, if the condemnation is for a public use and the owner receives just compensation.89 Courts have interpreted the public use requirement broad­ly to include uses for a ‘public purpose.’90 Conservation of natural habitat qualifies as a public purpose for the exercise of eminent domain.91 Thus, when the exercise of eminent domain is properly authorized (usually by statute) and just compensation is paid, agricultural and other rural land may be vulnerable to condemnation for conservation uses.&#13;
In some states, statutorily-authorized agricultural districts and conservation easements allow owners to protect agri­cultural land, either temporarily or permanently, from acqui­sition for conservation or other government uses. Though many statutes do not address the issue of eminent domain, and some do not restrict its exercise, others impose addition­al procedural requirements before eminent domain can be used to take protected agricultural land.92&#13;
Landowners who enter agricultural districts agree to lim­it the use of their land to agricultural purposes for a term of years, in exchange for statutorily-prescribed protections.93 Most state agricultural district statutes impose additional burdens before eminent domain can be used to acquire pro­tected land - for example, the right to notice and a hearing before condemnation, a requirement that alternatives to con­demnation be considered, or a requirement that the condem­nation be approved by a separate governing body.94&#13;
Conservation easements protect agricultural land over the long term by restricting the right to develop, while permit­ting continued agricultural use.95 In most cases, land subject to a conservation easement can be taken for a public use by eminent domain, and only a few states offer procedural pro­tections.96&#13;
4.2 Conservation Agreements&#13;
Since the 1930s, US agricultural legislation has offered fi­nancial and technical incentives for voluntary conservation measures, and a number of important new conservation programs have been enacted since 1985.97 Land retirement pro­grams claim 78% of conservation payments, mostly under the Conservation Reserve Program. Working land programs claim only 22% of conservation payments.98 USDA statis­tics, using 2009 data, estimate that rural residence and inter­mediate farms, rather than large commercial operations, re­ceived about 65% of payments (of $2.5 billion total) under major conservation programs, and about 38% of total gov­ernment payments to farmers.99&#13;
4.2.1 Working Land&#13;
Measures for working land provide incentives for agricul­tural producers to implement conservation measures that maintain the productivity of agricultural land and minimize harmful environmental effects.100&#13;
The largest USDA conservation program for working lands is the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP),101 intended ‘to promote agricultural production, forest manage­ment and environmental quality as compatible goals, and to optimize environmental benefits.’102 EQIP helps producers to comply with regulatory requirements concerning soil, wa­ter and air quality, wildlife habitat, and surface and ground­water conservation.103 It provides assistance to install and maintain conservation practices and facilitates conservation planning and regulatory compliance. By helping producers to meet environmental quality criteria, EQIP avoids the need for additional regulation.&#13;
EQIP authorizes contracts, lasting from one to 10 years, with producers who implement eligible environmental and conservation practices under an EQIP conservation plan.104 They receive payments for the cost of implementation of conservation practices, cost-share payments for installation of conservation structures, payments for income foregone, and technical assistance for developing a conservation plan. Environmental practices related to livestock production re­ceive 60% of EQIP funding.105&#13;
The Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP),106 encour­ages farmers to improve, maintain, and manage current con­servation activities and to undertake additional conservation practices.107 The CSP is a voluntary ‘payment for perform­ance’ program.108 Participants must meet conservation com­pliance requirements (protection of highly erodible land and wetlands) for receipt of federal farm program payments.109 Program acres are allocated by state, and about 12.8 million acres may be enrolled annually through 2017.110&#13;
To qualify for CSP, a producer must meet a ‘stewardship threshold’ for at least one resource concern at the time of the contract.111 More than 100 conservation activities qualify for payment. A Conservation Measurement Tool determines whether producers meet minimum requirements for eligibili­ty, calculates the effects of conservation activities, and helps to rank applicants for participation.112 Producers who are se­lected for participation enter a renewable 5-year stewardship contract and implement a conservation stewardship plan for the whole operation. They receive annual payments that re­ward both new and existing conservation activities, as well as resource-conserving crop rotations. Participants’ pay­ments reflect environmental benefits from their conservation practices.113&#13;
4.2.2 Land Retirement&#13;
The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), enacted in 1985 and reauthorized through 2012, retires environmentally sen­sitive cropland from production.114 Maximum authorized enrollment is 32 million acres through 2012 (reduced from 39.2 million acres through 2009). Eligible land must have a cropping history, and it must be highly erodible cropland, marginal pasture land, or specified other land that will pro­vide environmental benefits.115 Recent enrollments have fo­cused on high-priority field practices (e.g., filter strips), rath­er than whole fields.&#13;
Bids for CRP are submitted during a general sign-up peri­od,116 and the Farm Service Agency (FSA, part of USDA) uses an Environmental Benefits Index (EBI) to assigns points to various practices that provide environmental bene­fits. Factors important for the most recent sign-up in March-April 2011 were wildlife habitat benefits from conservation cover, water quality benefits, benefits that will endure, air quality benefits, and cost.117 The FSA ranks offers for CRP sign-up and enrolls land that provides maximum environ­mental benefits.&#13;
Under the CRP, agricultural owners, operators, or tenants enter 10- to 15-year contracts with the federal government. In exchange for annual rental payments, they retire land from agricultural use, implement an approved conservation plan, and plant an approved vegetative cover. The federal government offers technical assistance and shares the cost of establishing conservation practices required by contract.118 Participants established over 3.2 million acres of habitat, re­duced their application of nitrogen and phosphorus, and planted 2.7 million acres of trees.119 The CRP helped to re­duce erosion by taking marginal cropland out of production and establishing vegetative cover.&#13;
Because the 2008 Farm Bill reduced the size of the CRP, some environmental benefits will be lost. Moreover, many CRP contracts are scheduled to expire in the near future; 4.4 million acres expired 30 September 2011 and an additional 11.8 million will expire by 2014.120 When CRP contracts are not renewed, land can be returned to production of grain and other crops.121 Much of the land currently enrolled in the CRP could be farmed, although some is marginal. Farming marginal land may degrade habitats, increase erosion and fertilizer runoff, and diminish other important environmen­tal benefits (e.g., carbon sequestration).122&#13;
The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), enacted in 1990, protects farmed or converted wetlands through perma­nent easements, 30-year easements, restoration cost-share agreements, or a combination of these options.123 The WRP is small, with a maximum enrollment of about 3 million acres.124 Eligible land includes farmed or converted wet­lands (or flooded crop or grasslands), plus ‘functionally de­pendent’ land, that provide wildlife benefits and wetland values with a high likelihood of successful restoration.125 Priority for enrollment goes to wetlands that maximize wild­life values and have least likelihood of re-conversion at the end of the easement period.&#13;
Owners of WRP land grant an easement to the United States, record a deed restriction under state law, and implement a conservation plan. The conservation plan must prohibit al­teration of wildlife habitat and natural features, spraying or mowing, and other activities that interfere with wetland val­ues or the purposes of the WRP. In exchange, participants receive compensation for the easement plus cost-share pay­ments for conservation measures and technical assistance.&#13;
5. Conclusion&#13;
US rural land is abundant, and rural areas are valued for their productivity, as well as for natural beauty, forestry, habitat, open space, and recreational opportunities. The fed­eral government owns some rural land, including parks, wil­derness areas, forests, and grazing land. On these lands, leg­islation and agency policies focus on sustainable current land uses, as well as conservation for future generations.&#13;
The majority of US rural land is privately owned. On much of this land, US producers - both landowners and tenants - supply food and fiber for domestic and international mar­kets. Though some rural areas are subject to protective zon­ing, US landowners enjoy considerable freedom of land use. Moreover, although agricultural operations have been ex­&#13;
empt from some environmental requirements, farmers are likely to face more stringent environmental restrictions in the future.&#13;
The US has a long history of voluntary conservation prac­tices, often supported by incentives. Federal law authorizes both payments to producers who retire vulnerable land from production and support for implementation of important conservation measures on working land. Budget negotia­tions in Fall 2011 may alter these programs or reduce appro­priations available to support them. Moreover, a new Farm Bill, scheduled for 2012 and already under discussion, is ex­pected to change the parameters of support for agricultural producers in the US.&#13;
Finally, as the US and other nations address the issue of cli­mate change more seriously, agriculture may play a signif­icant role in mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases and sequestering carbon. Indeed, US agricultural policy has the potential to encourage producers and other landowners to adapt their practices to pursue climate-friendly activities on rural land.126&#13;

99. ERS, USDA, Farm Income and Costs: Farms Receiving Government Payments, http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/FarmIncome/govtpaybyfarmtype.htm (updated 14 Feb. 2011). Producers who receive government farm payments must follow conservation compliance requirements (16 USC §§ 3811, 3821; 7 CFR part 12), protect farmland from weeds and erosion, and plant a cover crop, where neces­sary (7 USC § 8716; 7 CFR § 1412.61).&#13;
100. Other conservation programs not discussed here include the Grasslands Reserve Program, designed to protect gra­zing uses and conservation values on eligible grassland (16 USC §§ 3838n-3838q; regulations at 7 CFR part 1415) and the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, which protects fish and wildlife habitats and species, especially those of national or regional significance, on private agricultural and forest land (16 USC § 3839bb-1; regulations at 7 CFR part 636). The Farmland Protection Program (16 USC §§ 3838h-3838i; regulations at 7 CFR part 149) provides matching funds for purchase of conservation easements on privately-owned productive farmland.&#13;
101. 16 USC §§ 3839aa-3839aa-9; regulations at 7 CFR part 1466. EQIP includes an Agricultural Water Enhancement Program, 16 USC § 3839aa-9.&#13;

114. 16 USC §§ 3831-3835a; regulations at 7 CFR part 1410. Of the 40 million acres of farmland idled in 2002, 85% were part of the CRP, and one million acres were enrolled in the Wetlands Reserve. Lubowski et al., supra note 2, at 14.&#13;
115. 16 USC § 3831(b),(d).&#13;
116. Continuous sign-up applies to small areas of land to be set aside for purposes like filter strips, riparian buffers, windbreaks, etc. About 4 million acres are reserved for this program, which pays higher rents. A farmable wetland program, expanded in 2008, may enroll up to 1 million acres. The Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), with cooperation from state and local entities, identifies and retires environmentally sensitive land with high priority for the state or nation. As of 31 May 2011, 3.8 million acres (including 279,00 farmable wetland acres) were enrolled in continuous sign-up and 1.25 million acres in CREP.
