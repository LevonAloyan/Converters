a large surplus of animal manure. Application of excessive amounts of manure&#13;
causes extreme overdosing of minerals (nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium) and&#13;
heavy metals (copper, cadmium, zinc). Accumulation of these minerals and heavy&#13;
metals results in lower soil fertility and crop quality, as well as health hazards for&#13;
livestock. Leaching and runoff of minerals into ground and surface waters threaten&#13;
public water supplies and cause other environmental damage. Unpleasant stenches&#13;
and acid depositions also occur.1&#13;
Although the Meststoffenwet and the Hinderwet regulated some aspects of&#13;
manure trade and storage, the manure surplus demanded special legislation to&#13;
address the serious environmental consequences of unlimited production and use of&#13;
manure. The resulting laws, the new Meststoffenwet and the Wet bodembescherming,&#13;
along with the related regulations and decrees, have already been the focus&#13;
of analysis in issues of Agrarisch recht. This system of legislation is complex and&#13;
detailed, and it is tailored carefully to the manure surplus it is meant to address.&#13;
This Dutch solution to the manure surplus contrasts significantly with the type&#13;
of law and regulation enacted in America. Though animal wastes contribute to&#13;
pollution of United States ground and sur face waters, no comprehensive program&#13;
governs the amount of manure that farm operatioms may produce or the application,&#13;
transport, and trade in manure. Instead, as this article indicates, pollution&#13;
from manure is addressed in the United States in a number of separate but interrelated&#13;
laws and regulations, both federal and state, some of which focus only&#13;
incidentally on manure. This approach can be explained in part by the organization&#13;
of the American legal system; both federal and state lawmakers have jurisdiction&#13;
(sometimes concurrently) over different activities connected with the livestock&#13;
industry and the environment.2 Much of the responsibility for controlling pollution&#13;
from agriculture, including manure pollution, rests with state governments.&#13;
This article provides an overview of federal and state regulation in the United&#13;
States that governs the various aspects of manure production, storage, and application.&#13;
After brief discussions of the extent of manure pollution and fertilizer laws,&#13;
the article focuses on control of water and air pollution. In addition it surveys&#13;
typical state laws and regulations that govern application of livestock wastes and&#13;
operation of livestock facilities. </inleiding><content>1. MANURE POLLUTION IN THE UNITED STATES&#13;
In the United States, as in the Netherlands, agriculturally-related water pollution&#13;
has become an increasingly serious problem. At least thirty-five of the fifty states&#13;
have reported concern about high nutriënt levels in water supplies.3 This pollution&#13;
from agriculture has two major components: erosion-transported pollutants, such&#13;
as pesticide and fertilizer residues, and waste from concentrated animal feeding&#13;
operations.4 Although more attention in recent years has been devoted to pollution&#13;
from agricultural chemicals,5 livestock waste continues to contribute to the pollution&#13;
of both surface and groundwater.6 Significant quantities of nitrogen and phosphorous&#13;
find their way into the nation's waters.7 In fact, large numbers of animals on a&#13;
farm may cause a pollution load equivalent to a city of two million people.8&#13;
A significant amount of animal manure is produced in the United States. Preliminary&#13;
figures for 1987 indicate that the national livestock population included&#13;
102.47 million cattle and calves, 50.96 million hogs and pigs, 10.33 million sheep&#13;
and lambs, 368.68 million chickens, and 207.22 million turkeys.9 Annual total&#13;
production of animal manure has been estimated to be 1.5 billion tons per year&#13;
— almost enough to apply one ton per acre on each of the 1.9 billion acres of&#13;
continental United States.10 Although manure can be an effective fertilizer (especially&#13;
for crops like corn, which requires significant amounts of nitrogen), it is inconvenient&#13;
to use outside areas of animal production. According to a recent study, manure was&#13;
applied on sixteen percent of all surveyed corn acres, but on fewer acres of other&#13;
crops.11&#13;
In days when animals were maintained on the range or pasture, manure was deposited over relatively large land areas that could accommodate wastes without&#13;
undue environmental stress. Now, however, as significant numbers of animals are&#13;
raised in confinement, large amounts of manure are produced in relatively small&#13;
areas; that manure accumulates in large quantities when the feedlot lacks adequate&#13;
land on which to distribute the wastes. To make the problem worse, animals fed in&#13;
the confinement may actually produce more manure than those grazing on a range.12&#13;
Accumulated manure attracts insects and carries odors, creating a nuisance in the&#13;
area of the livestock operation. As in the Netherlands, serious harmful environmental&#13;
effects occur when pollutants from the manure move beyond the immediate locality.13&#13;
2. FERTILIZER LAWS&#13;
As in the Netherlands, fertilizer products are subject to regulation in the United&#13;
States. In fact, nearly every state has laws and regulations that govern the manufacture,&#13;
sale, and distribution of fertilizer products. Although the laws vary somewhat&#13;
from state to state, provisions of these laws normally focus on location of manufacturing&#13;
facilities, registration of fertilizers, proper manufacture, and accurate labeling.&#13;
These laws, however, generally do not regulate 'unmanipulated animal manures.'14&#13;
Thus, insofar as unprocessed manure is concerned, the state laws function rather&#13;
differently from the Meststoffenwet.15&#13;
3. WATER POLLUTION CONTROL&#13;
A number of legislative and regulatory programs relevant to animal wastes operate&#13;
at both federal and state levels, sometimes coordinated in a system of cooperative&#13;
federalism. The most significant of these laws focus on water pollution.16 Early&#13;
federal efforts to control water pollution placed major responsibility for implementation on the states. When this approach failed, Congress enacted the&#13;
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972.17 This law, inteded 'to&#13;
restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's&#13;
waters',18 introduced an enhanced federal role in the control of water pollution.&#13;
Regulation under the 1972 Amendments focuses on two types of pollution sources,&#13;
point and nonpoint. The regulatory schemes for the two types of sources differ. A&#13;
point source is 'any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance including ... (a)&#13;
concentrated animal feeding operation ... from which pollutants are or may be&#13;
discharged.'19 Nonpoint sources, not defined in the statute, include other sources&#13;
of pollution, particularly those that occur as a consequence of diffused land activities.&#13;
A source of animal wastes that is not a 'concentrated animal feeding operation'&#13;
would be considered a nonpoint source of water pollution. Thus the regulatory&#13;
provisions for both point and nonpoint source water pollution are relevant in&#13;
connection with manure.&#13;
3.1. Point source pollution&#13;
Under the federal law, discharge of pollution from point sources into navigable&#13;
waters20 is monitored through a system of permits, the National Pollutant&#13;
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).21 Individual states may be authorized to&#13;
administer their own permit programs for discharges into navigable waters within&#13;
their jurisdictions.22 The federal and state permit systems, however, are based on&#13;
effluent limitations for pollutants and performance standards for new sources of&#13;
pollution, authorized by law23 and established by the federal Environmental Protection&#13;
Agency (EPA).24&#13;
The EPA has promulgated regulations establishing effluent limitations and performance&#13;
standards for feedlots, the most significant point source of pollution from&#13;
agriculture.25 As defined in the regulations, a feedlot (mesterij) is 'a concentrated,&#13;
confined animal or poultry growing operation for meat, milk or egg production, or&#13;
stabling, in pens or houses wherein the animals or poultry are fed at the place of confinement and crop or forage growth or production is not sustained in the area of&#13;
confinement.'26 The regulations govern feedlots for different types of animals and&#13;
confinement configurations27 that contain a large number of animal units.28&#13;
In essence, the effluent limitation regulation allows no discharge of 'process waste&#13;
water' pollutants from a f eedlot operation to navigable waters.29 An exception,&#13;
however, permits pollutants to be discharged from overflow of water due to chronic&#13;
or catastrophic rainfalls, if the facility is designed, constructed and operated to contain&#13;
all the normal waste waters plus the runoff from a '25-year, 24-hour rainfall event.'30&#13;
In addition to these effluent limitations, the regulations set standards of performance&#13;
for new feedlot sources of pollution. Again, the Standard is no discharge of&#13;
process waste water pollutants to navigable waters, with an exception for the 25-&#13;
year, 24-hour rainfall event.31&#13;
'Concentrated animal feeding operations' are point sources subject to the NPDES&#13;
permit program, under federal law and in state NPDES programs.32 An 'animal&#13;
feeding operation,' for purposes of NPDES permitting, is a lot or facility where&#13;
animals are confined and fed for 45 days or more in any 12-month period, and&#13;
where crops, vegetation, forage growth, or post-harvest residues are not sustained&#13;
over any portion of the lot in the normal growing season. Such an operation is&#13;
'concentrated' when it meets size criteria established by regulation, or when it is so&#13;
designated after case-by-case evaluation.33 An operation is concentrated if it contains&#13;
more than 1000 animal units,34 or if it contains more than 300 animal units, and pollutants are discharged into navigable waters through a man-made device or&#13;
directly into waters of the United States. No animal feeding operation is concentrated,&#13;
however, if it discharges only in a 25-year, 24-hour storm event.35&#13;
When an animal feeding operation is required to obtain an NPDES permit, that&#13;
permit will govern the discharge of pollutants. If the operation complies with the&#13;
terms and conditions of the permit, it will normally be in compliance with the&#13;
Federal Water Pollution Control Act.36 Those who violate the terms and conditions&#13;
of their permits are strictly liable; violators may face significant civil or criminal&#13;
penalties. The EPA exercises some discretion, however, when an operator has been&#13;
attempting in good faith to comply or violates for a reason beyond its control.37&#13;
The NPDES permit provision for concentrated animal feeding operations, like&#13;
other provisions, may form part of a state implementation program under the&#13;
Act.38 Most states have accepted responsibility for the permit program.39 Wisconsin, for&#13;
example, has enacted the Wisconsin pollutant discharge elimination system,40 which&#13;
requires permits for discharges of pollutants from large animal feeding operations&#13;
and other operations discharging significant amounts of pollution into waters of&#13;
the state. Permanent runoff control structures must meet the 25-year, 24-hour&#13;
rainfall event design Standard, and permit holders must have and implement an&#13;
approved animal waste management plan.41&#13;
Similarly, in Illinois, the Livestock Waste Regulations comply with the federal&#13;
NPDES program and implement the Illinois Environmental Protection Act.42 They&#13;
apply to all livestock feedlots in Illinois. Although the regulations contain a number&#13;
of provisions for feedlot design and waste management, the NPDES permitting&#13;
provisions are central. In Illinois, a significant number of feedlots pollute because&#13;
they lack effective runoff control or require modifications in management. Nonetheless,&#13;
only an extremely small number (28, in 1986) of the state's 58,000 feedlots&#13;
have obtained NPDES permits under the regulations.43 Compliance with the&#13;
NPDES program would burden feedlot operators financially; thus, the state EPA has not enforced the permit regulations stringently. Instead, f eedlot operators must&#13;
comply with other aspects of the Livestock Waste Regulations.44&#13;
3.2 Nonpoint source pollution&#13;
Livestock farms that are not 'concentrated animal feeding operations' (that is,&#13;
point sources) under the NPDES permit program - and most livestock operations&#13;
are not point sources - nonetheless produce manure. Livestock wastes from these&#13;
sources help contribute to the problem of nonpoint source pollution, which comes&#13;
from diffused land-use activities. These pollution sources are not subject to effluent&#13;
limitations or NPDES permits;45 instead, they are addressed by 'section 208 planning'&#13;
46 and state water quality planning,47 both mandated by the Federal Water&#13;
Pollution Control Act.&#13;
Section 208 requires states to develop and implement state and areawide waste&#13;
treatment management plans, designed to meet water quality standards established&#13;
by each state.48 The planning process deals with a wide variety of sources of water&#13;
pollution. Agricultural nonpoint pollution is included; the planning process must&#13;
'identify, if appropriate, agriculturally ... related nonpoint sources of pollution,&#13;
including return flows from irrigated agriculture, ... runoff from manure disposal&#13;
areas, and from land used for livestock and erop production, and ... set forth&#13;
procedures and methods (including land use requirements) to control to the extent&#13;
feasible such sources.'49&#13;
Regulations governing state water quality management plans provide for the use&#13;
of 'best management practices' to control nonpoint source pollution.50 Because&#13;
much of agricultural nonpoint source pollution involves soil erosion, these practices&#13;
include soil conservation techniques for erosion control. To ensure incorporation of&#13;
best management practices, the law authorizes a program of cost sharing and&#13;
technical assistance, which includes five to ten year contracts with landowners who&#13;
install and maintain best management practices and who agree to manage their&#13;
farms according to a conservation plan.51&#13;
State section 208 plans have been implemented, and federal involvement in this&#13;
regulatory effort is now rather minimal. The majority of these state plans, however, do not incorporate regulatory programs for agricultural nonpoint pollution. Instead,&#13;
they rely on voluntary programs with cost-share provisions.52 For example, an&#13;
important component of section 208 planning in Illinois is the Erosion and Sediment&#13;
Control Program, which includes state guidelines and local standards to reduce soil&#13;
losses. Although a complaint system helps to identify violators, the program relies&#13;
on cost-sharing incentives and voluntary cooperation of farmers. Focus on soil&#13;
erosion, to the exclusion of other aspects of nonpoint pollution from agriculture,&#13;
means that little special effort has been made to control pollution from animal&#13;
manure. As one commentator noted, 'Generally, the effect has been that a source&#13;
of pollution which evades legal definition as a point source also evades effective&#13;
regulation and control.'53&#13;
4. AIR POLLUTION&#13;
Much of the attention given to animal waste in connection with air pollution in the&#13;
United States has focused on odors,54 rather than on acid depositions from&#13;
ammonia in the manure. A livestock facility, even a well-managed operation, always&#13;
causes some odor. Although the proper equipment and handling methods can of ten&#13;
minimize offensive smells, operators do not always use the most effective means of&#13;
controlling odors.55 As a result, interference with surrounding property may give&#13;
rise to claims that laws prohibiting air pollution have been violated, as well as&#13;
allegations that the common law tort of nuisance has been committed.&#13;
In general, U.S. air pollution laws are not particularly effective in preventing or&#13;
providing remedies for air pollution caused by animal manure. The federal Clean&#13;
Air Act56 includes a complex legislative structure designed to protect and enhance&#13;
the quality of the nation's air resources.57 The Clean Air Act requires federal&#13;
regulation to establish national ambient air quality standards; in addition, it requires&#13;
state implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of those standards.58 Because&#13;
the law relies on objective measurement of pollutants, it has not been effective in&#13;
controlling odors, which are difficult to measure objectively.59 Moreover, if future&#13;
regulation under the Act should focus on odors, agricultural odors are unlikely to&#13;
receive priority for regulation.60 The Clean Air Act thus offers little potential for&#13;
abating air pollution from animal manure. Some state environmental protection laws have been more effective. The definition&#13;
of air pollution under state law sometimes includes odorous substances,61 at least&#13;
when the odors cause unreasonable interference with the rights of others.62 And,&#13;
indeed, state environmental protection laws have been used to abate air (that is,&#13;
odor) pollution from livestock operations.63 The standards for determining whether&#13;
an unreasonable odor exists tend to be subjective, however, and the process of&#13;
analysis in these cases is much like the approach used in agricultural nuisance suits.&#13;
Odor problems from animal manure have traditionally been addressed through&#13;
nuisance litigation, which is usually based on common-law principles, rather than&#13;
on a statute like the Hinderwet. Most litigation involving agricultural nuisance has&#13;
focused on undesirable smells emanating from a feedlot or other farming operations.&#13;
A nuisance suit against an animal operation may succeed if the conduct of the&#13;
operator interferes unreasonably with a neighboring landowner's use or enjoyment&#13;
of property (private nuisance), or if the conduct interferes unreasonably with the&#13;
health, safety, and welfare of the public as a whole (public nuisance).64 The&#13;
outcome of nuisance suits is determined by a process of judicial balancing that&#13;
considers a number of factors; these include the type of nuisance and the land use&#13;
in the surrounding area.&#13;
Plaintiffs have had mixed success in nuisance suits against animal operations,&#13;
particularly against those located in rural areas. Moreover, in recent years, nearly&#13;
every state has enacted a right-to-farm law, which significantly limits nuisance suits&#13;
against agricultural operations. These laws generally apply to protect a farm that&#13;
is properly managed, when that farm is claimed to be a nuisance because of a recent&#13;
change in land use in the agricultural area. That is, when someone moves to a rural&#13;
area and then claims that the existing agricultural activities create a nuisance, the rightto-&#13;
farm law often protects the farmer.65 Thus, it must be concluded that common&#13;
law nuisance actions offer little promise for abating pollution from animal manure.&#13;
5. STATE REGULATION CONNECTED WITH ANIMAL MANURE&#13;
A number of state laws and regulations, in addition to those connected with air and&#13;
water pollution, deal directly or indirectly with animal manure. For example, some state laws and regulations govern the location of feedlot&#13;
facilities, as well as proper storage, handling, and use of animal wastes.66 Several&#13;
states have enacted feedlot licensing acts.67 The Oklahoma Feed Yards Act, which&#13;
is typical of other feedlot laws, makes it unlawful to operate a large livestock feedlot&#13;
without first obtaining a license.68 Licensed owners and operators must take specific&#13;
measures to dispose of excrement properly and to avoid water poUution.69&#13;
A fee is charged for each license, and a license may be suspended or revoked for&#13;
violation of the feed yards law or regulations. Significant penalties may be assessed&#13;
for violation of the law or its regulations.70&#13;
5.1 Field application of livestock waste&#13;
Improper or excessive application of manure causes significant water pollution.&#13;
Thus, several states have promulgated regulations to govern, or at least provide guidelines&#13;
for, field application of livestock waste. The Illinois guidelines71 are rather&#13;
detailed and in spirit resemble Dutch manure regulation.72 These guidelines are&#13;
based on the regulatory premise that '[t]he quantity of livestock waste applied on soils&#13;
shall not exceed a practical limit as determined by soil type, especially its permeability,&#13;
the condition (frozen or unfrozen) of the soil, the percent slope of the land, cover mulch, proximity to surface waters and likelihood of reaching groundwater, and&#13;
other relevant considerations.'73&#13;
Livestock waste application should not exceed the 'agronomic nitrogen rate' -&#13;
the annual application rate of nitrogen needed for a reasonable crop yield. When&#13;
this rate is used, the phosphorus applied will often exceed crop requirements; in some&#13;
instances, the agronomic phosphorus rate may thus be used. Although individual&#13;
farmers are encouraged to perform a chemical analysis to determine the nutriënt&#13;
content of livestock wastes, the guidelines give data to aid in estimating the nutriënt&#13;
value of wastes from different types of animals and various management systems.&#13;
Further data, on nitrogen production and the number of animal units needed to&#13;
provide 100 pounds of nitrogen per year, is provided to help farmers determine the&#13;
adequacy of the land area of their enterprise for manure application.74&#13;
Other restrictions on field application focus on water and odor pollution. Waste&#13;
should usually not be applied within 200 feet of surface water or within 150 feet of&#13;
any water well; bacteria or nitrate contamination of groundwater should be avoided.&#13;
Waste should not be applied in a 10-year flood plain unless it is injected or incorporated&#13;
into the soil. It should not be applied during a rainfall, on saturated soil, or&#13;
in waterways, nor should it be applied on frozen or snow-covered ground, unless&#13;
slopes are gentle or erosion is controlled. Farmers are directed to consider methods&#13;
of application, location, and climatic conditions, to avoid unnecessary odors from&#13;
manure.75&#13;
5.2. Operational rules for livestock facilities&#13;
Operational rules for livestock facilities are also intended to prevent animal wastes&#13;
from polluting water sources.76 These operational rules typically focus on location&#13;
of facilities and handling of manure. For example, the Illinois Livestock Waste&#13;
Regulations state that new livestock facilities may not have streams or other surface&#13;
waters within their boundaries, and that they may not be located near populated&#13;
areas.77 The facilities must take measures to avoid both flooding and groundwater pollution.78 All facilities must prevent excessive outside surface waters from flowing&#13;
through the operation, and must direct runoff to an appropriate disposal, holding,&#13;
or storage area.79&#13;
The regulations also govern the storage and handling of waste. All waste stored&#13;
over six months must be contained in an impermeable or sealed manure storage&#13;
structure with adequate storage capacity. Temporary manure stacks must not be&#13;
located within 100 feet of a water well; they must be constructed and maintained&#13;
to prevent pollution of ground and surface waters.80&#13;
The Illinois Livestock Waste Regulations also include technical design and maintenance&#13;
criteria for runoff field application systems81 as an alternative to manure&#13;
holding tanks, ponds, or lagoons. They may be used only for livestock facilities with&#13;
300 or fewer animal units. These vegetative filter systems are relatively inexpensive,&#13;
but require careful design and maintenance. The regulations prescribe in detail the&#13;
type of facility; they give specific procedures and calculations to be used in design.&#13;
They prescribe the type of vegetation to be used for the field application area, and&#13;
specify how that vegetation must be established. In addition, the regulations set&#13;
requirements for operation and maintenance of the system.82&#13;
6. CONCLUSION&#13;
As the above discussion indicates, law and regulation connected with animal manure&#13;
in the United States can be found in a number of different statutory schemes.&#13;
Federal environmental protection laws, state implementations of these federal laws,&#13;
and independent state livestock laws all play a role in governing livestock wastes.&#13;
This system, however, displays a number of deficiencies. For example, federal environmental&#13;
protection laws (and state implementations) are effective in governing only&#13;
a small percentage of livestock operations. Separate state laws and regulations apply&#13;
to some aspects of livestock farms, including manure storage and application. Those&#13;
laws, however, vary from state to state, and enforcement is not always vigorous.&#13;
Until now, more attention has been paid - and in the future will be paid - to&#13;
pollution from agricultural chemicals. Ultimately, however, livestock wastes must&#13;
also receive more focused regulation, if all sources of water and air pollution are&#13;
to be abated successfully. Indeed, the United States has not yet dealt seriously nough with pollution from agriculture. And, as one scholar recently noted, more&#13;
stringent regulation may evolve: 'It is inevitable that the agricultural pollution&#13;
problem will eventually require the direct regulation of individual farms, just as we&#13;
now regulate the environmental effects of industry, commerce and governments.'83&#13;
In that event, the Dutch experience with regulation designed to abate pollution from&#13;
manure may well prove informative to the American agricultural and legal communities. </content><legacyfootnotes>1. Nota van toelichting, Besluit dierlijke meststoffen, Besluit van 25 maart 1987, Stb. 114, at 7.&#13;

18. 33 U.S.C.A § 1251(a) (West 1986 &amp; Supp. 1989).&#13;
19. ld. § 1362(14). The definition continues, 'This term does not include return flows from irrigated&#13;
agriculture.' On this last statement, which was added in 1987 by Pub. L. No. 95-217, § 33(b), 91 Stat.&#13;
1577, see Davidson, Little Waters: The Relationship Between Water PoUution and Agricultural Drainage,&#13;
17 Environmental Law Reporter (Environmental Law Institute) 10074 (1987). No NPDES permits (see&#13;
infra) may be required for return flows from irrigated agriculture. 33 U.S.C.A. § 1342(1)(1) (West 1986&#13;
&amp; Supp. 1989).&#13;
20. 33 U.S.C.A. § 1362(7) (West 1986 &amp; Supp. 1989) defines navigable waters broadly as 'the waters of&#13;
the United States, including the territorial seas.'&#13;
21. ld. § 1342.&#13;
22. ld. § 1342(b).&#13;
23. ld. §§ 1311, 1316.&#13;
24. The federal EPA is an administrative agency charged with implementation of numerous environ&#13;
mental laws. It has rulemaking and adjudicatory power, as delegated by statute. For more details about&#13;
establishment of these standards, see 2 N. Harl, supra note 13, at § 14.02[2][a], [b].&#13;
25. 40 C.F.R. Part 412 - Feedlots Point Source Category (1988).&#13;
26. Id. § 412.1 l(b). See also § 412.21(b).&#13;
27. Id. § 412.10. The regulations apply to various types of feedlots (e.g., open or housed lots for beef;&#13;
solid or slotted floors for swine) for beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, sheep, horses, chickens, turkeys.&#13;
Duck operations with 5000 or more ducks are treated as a separate category. ld. § 412.20-.26.&#13;
28. 7irf.,§ 412.10. Feedlot operations are regulated under Part 412 if they are as large or larger than the&#13;
following capacities: 1000 slaughter steers and heifers (vaars) or mature dairy cattle; 2500 swine weighing&#13;
over 55 pounds; 10,000 sheep; 55,000 turkeys; 100,000 laying hens or broilers (with unlimited continuous&#13;
flow watering system); 20,000 laying hens or broilers (liquid manure handling system); 500 horses; or&#13;
1000 nonpoultry animal units.&#13;
29. ld. § 412.13(a). 'Process waste water' refers to water used directly or indirectly in feedlot operation&#13;
that comes in contact with manure, litter, bedding, or other materials or animal products in the feedlot.&#13;
ld. §412.11(c), (d).&#13;
30. ld. § 412.13(b). A '25-year, 24-hour rainfall event' is 'a [24-hour] rainfall event with a probable&#13;
recurrence interval of once in ... twenty-five years ..." ld. § 412.11(e).&#13;
This effluent limitation is the standard for the 'best available technology economically achievable'&#13;
(BAT). The standard for the 'best practicable control technology currently available' (BPT) permits no&#13;
discharge of process waste water pollutants, but allows overflow in a 10-year, 24-hour rainfall event. Id.&#13;
§ 412.12. Originally, effluent limitations were to be established in two stages: BPT by 1 July 1977, and&#13;
BAT by 1 July 1983. Amendments to the law in 1977 altered this schedule. Pub. L. No. 95-217, 91 Stat.&#13;
1566 (1977). After these amendments, effluent limitations for 'conventional' pollutants must require&#13;
'best conventional technology' (BCT), a somewhat less stringent standard, while limitations for nonconventional&#13;
and toxic pollutants must generally require BAT. 33 U.S.C.A. § 131 l(b) (West 1986 &amp;&#13;
Supp. 1989). Part 412 does not refer to BCT.&#13;
31. 40 C.F.R. § 412.15 (1988). Pretreatment standards for new sources and for existing sources are at&#13;
id. § 412.14 and § 412.16. The performance standards and NPDES permit requirements for feedlots focus&#13;
on protection of surface water, rather than on groundwater. The 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event standard,&#13;
for example, can prevent contaminant spillover into surface waters, but does not prevent leaching of&#13;
feedlot pollutants into groundwater sources. Sivas, supra note 5, at 136-37.&#13;
32. 40 C.F.R. § 122.23(a) (1988). See also id. § 123.25(a)(6).&#13;
33. Id. §§ 122.23(b), 122.24 (c).&#13;
34. The number of 'animal units' is calculated as follows: the number of slaughter and feeder cattle&#13;
multiplied by 1.0; mature dairy cattle multiplied by 1.4; swine weighing over 25 kilograms multiplied 0.4;&#13;
sheep multiplied by 0.1; horses multiplied by 2.0. 40 C.F.R. Part. 122, Appendix B (1988). &#13;
35. ld., Part 122, Appendix B (1988). State regulations incorporate this 25-year, 24-hour Standard. See,&#13;
e.g., Ohio Admin. Code § 1501:15-5-07 (1986), which requires concentrated animal feeding operations,&#13;
broadly defined, to be constructed to withstand the 25-year, 24-hour storm. See also Wis. Admin. Code&#13;
§ NR 243.06 (1984), which quantifies 10-year and 25-year, 24-hour rainfall events, in inches of rain, for&#13;
counties in Wisconsin.&#13;

54. See, e.g., 2 N. Harl, supra note 13, § 13.01.&#13;
55. The common causes of odor complaints are 'improper site location, poor facility management, and&#13;
surface spreading of liquid manure.' Taylor &amp; Hutton, Resolving Odor Conflicts: Management and&#13;
Legal Alternatives 1 (111. EPA, 1983) The livestock waste lagoon is also a source of odors.&#13;

60. See 2 N. Harl, supra note 13, § 13.O3[3].&#13;
61. E.g., 111. Rev. Stat., ch. 111 1/2, §§ 1003.02, 1003.06 (1987); Vt. Stat. Ann. tit 10, § 552 (1984 &amp;&#13;
Supp. 1988).&#13;
62. The Illinois Environmental Protection Act is typical. 'Air pollution' is defined as 'the presence in&#13;
the atmosphere of one or more contaminants in sufficient quantities and of such characteristics and&#13;
duration as to be injurious to human, plant, or animal life, to health, or to property, or to unreasonably&#13;
interfere with the enjoyment of life or property.' 111. Rev. Stat., ch. 111 l/2,§ 1003.02 (1987). 'Contaminant'&#13;
is then defined as 'any solid, liquid, or gaseous matter, any odor, or any form of energy, from&#13;
whatever source.' ld. § 1003.06. Thus, an odor that interfered unreasonably with enjoyment of life or&#13;
property would constitute air pollution under Illinois law. For decisions finding that odors from agri&#13;
cultural operations violate the Act, see, e.g., EPA v. Hicks, 35 111. PCB 91 (1979); EPA v. Processing&#13;
&amp; Books, Inc., 7 111. PCB 729 (1973).&#13;

65. See generally Grossman &amp; Fischer, supra note 63.&#13;
66. The discussion that follows makes no attempt to provide comprehensive information about state&#13;
feedlot regulation. Instead, it provides some representative examples drawn from statutes and regulations.&#13;
67. E.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 24-391 to -397 (1983 &amp; Supp. 1988); Ind. Code Ann. §§ 13-1-5.7-1&#13;
to -7 (West 1986 &amp; Supp. 1988); Kan. Stat. Ann. §§ 47-1501 to -1511 (1986 &amp; Supp. 1988); Okla. Stat.&#13;
Ann. tit. 2, §§ 9-201 to -215 (West 1974 &amp; Supp. 1989). See also Minn. R. 7020.0100-. 1900 (requiring&#13;
permits for feedlots larger than 10 animal units).&#13;
68. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 2, § 9-208 (Supp. 1989). Prior to amendment in 1981, the law applied to livestock&#13;
feed yards with a capacity of more than 250 animal units. ld. § 9-202(a), (f) (1974). The amended version&#13;
requires licenses for 'concentrated animal feeding operations,' using the definition applied in federal&#13;
NPDES feedlot regulations (supra text accompanying note 26). Other feed yards may also apply for a&#13;
license. ld. § 9-208 (Supp. 1989).&#13;
69. ld. § 9-210 (1974). As it concerns manure, the statute requires that 'Owners and operators who are&#13;
granted a feed yards license shall: (1) provide reasonable methods for the disposal of animal excrement;&#13;
... (3) provide adequate drainage from feed yards premises of surface waters falling upon the area&#13;
occupied by such feed yards; take such action as may be necessary to avoid pollution of any stream, lake,&#13;
river or creek;... (5) have available for use at all necessary times mechanical means of scraping, cleaning,&#13;
and grading feed yards premises; (6) provide weather resistant aprons adjacent to all permanently affixed&#13;
feed bunks, water tanks, and feeding devices....... ' Compliance with the law and regulations is prima facie&#13;
evidence that a nuisance does not exist, provided zoning regulations are followed. ld. For a nearly&#13;
identical provision, see Kan. Stat. Ann. § 47-1505 (1986).&#13;
70. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 2, §§ 9-209, -211, -212 (1974 &amp; Supp. 1989).&#13;
71. State of Illinois, Rules and Regulations, Title 35: Environmental Protection, Subtitle E: Agriculture&#13;
Related Pollution, Chapter II: Environmental Protection Agency, Part 560: Design Criteria for Field&#13;
Application of Livestock Waste (1984) (codified at 6 111. Reg. 10558). See also 2 N. Harl, supra note 13,&#13;
at § 14.03 [3] for excerpts from Iowa field application guidelines, including provisions for timely application,&#13;
placement away from waterways, and incorporation into soil.&#13;
72. Some other state regulations are less detailed. See, e.g., Ore. Admin. R. 340-51-070 (1981), which&#13;
states in part that 'Field spreading of [solid] manure should be uniform in distribution and limited in&#13;
quantity to the capacity of the land to retain it.' See also Ohio Admin. Code § 1501: 15-5-05 (1986), which&#13;
requires application of animal waste 'to achieve maximum utilization of the nutrients in manure for crop&#13;
production and to minimize the potential for water pollution ....' Factors to be considered include the&#13;
nutriënt content of manure, as well as the amount and type of available land.&#13;
73. Illinois Rules and Regulations, Title 35, Subtitle E, Chapter I, Part 501.405 (1984). A proposed revision&#13;
to this section (dated 12 October 1988) would add a subsection specifying that livestock waste may not&#13;
be applied within 1/4 mile of a populated area or inhabited residence unless it is incorporated within 24&#13;
hours or applied by direct injection. An exception would apply between 1 December and 1 March if the&#13;
only land available to the livestock producer is within 1/4 mile of a populated area or inhabited residence.&#13;
Mulch is a covering (e.g., straw or leaves) spread or left on the ground to prevent evaporation or&#13;
erosion.&#13;
74. Illinois Rules and Regulations, Title 35, Subtitle E, Chap. II, § 560.201. For example, yield of nitrogen&#13;
from a 1000-pound beef animal will be 43-87 pounds per year with pit storage of manure, or 50-62&#13;
pounds/year in solids and runoff from an open lot. A 100-pound hog yields 6-12 pounds/year with pit&#13;
storage and 7-8 pounds/year on open lot. A 4-pound poultry animal yields 0.4-0.6 pounds nitrogen per&#13;
year. ld., Table 3.&#13;
75. ld. §§ 560.203-.208.&#13;
76. See, e.g., Tex Admin. Code, tit. 31, §§ 321.31-.38 (Supp. 1988).&#13;
77. Illinois Rules and Regulations, Title 35, Subtitle E, Chap. II, § 501.402. A draft amendment (12&#13;
October 1988) would prevent new facilities from being located within 1/2 mile of a populated area (with&#13;
10 inhabited residences or 50 persons) or within 1/4 mile of an inhabited residence. Some exceptions to&#13;
this distance requirement would be possible.&#13;
78. ld. § 501.402. See also Ohio Admin. Code § 1501:15-5-02 to -04 (1986), requiring construction of&#13;
animal waste management facilities to avoid pollution. Cost sharing for animal waste storage or management&#13;
facilities and other purposes is available, ld., § 1501:15-5-08.&#13;
79.Illinois Rules and Regulations, Title 35, Subtitle E, Chap. II, § 501.403. For new facilities, a holding&#13;
pond must have a prescribed storage volume, which can never be less than the 25-year 24-hour storm&#13;
effluent guidelines for feedlot point sources under the NPDES program. ld. See supra, text accompanying&#13;
notes 21-44, on NPDES.&#13;
