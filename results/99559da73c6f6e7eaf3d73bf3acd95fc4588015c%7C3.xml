Introduction&#13;
The U.S. farm economy remains strong. Generally high commodity prices for grains have led to higher land prices in areas with good crop land and robust sales of agricultural equipment. However, debate on the Farm Bill shows strong rural support for governmental assistance programs for agricultural producers but not for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program providing help to low-income families. This paper reviews several noteworthy developments concerning rural environmental law, aspects of the food chain, and other issues confronting rural America.</inleiding><content>2. Rural Environmental Law&#13;
While the United States is not rushing to add to laws and regulations providing protection to the environment, environmental issues continue to be very significant to rural America. The most significant environmental issue concerns potential pollution from fracturing for shale gas using hydraulic fracturing technology. Other environmental issues drawing the public’s attention are the regulation of pollutants from large concentrated animal feeding operations, pesticide residues, the application of biosolids to land, and the production of biofuels.&#13;
A. Hydraulic Fracturing&#13;
Hydraulic fracturing (fracking) has contributed to an infusion of money and jobs in rural economies. By using horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing, it is commercially viable to tap deep deposits of shale gas. However, fracturing for natural gas is controversial because well drilling and production may lead to environmental pollution. Lands and surface waters can become contaminated by the disposal of wastewater from fracturing activities. Persons dependent on drinking water sources are concerned about contamination by the toxic substances in fracturing fluids.1 In addition, significant releases of air pollutants accompany gas extraction activities that may be adverse to human health.2&#13;
Hydraulic fracturing involves drilling wells and injecting large quantities of water mixed with specially-formulated chemical mixtures and granular material at high pressures. This process cracks open the rocks that store petroleum resources allowing their contents to flow to the surface. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that more than 11,000 new wells are fractured each year in the United States and another 1,400 are re-fractured.3 For 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy estimated that shale gas accounts for approximately 30% of the country’s natural gas.4 Moreover, the extraction activities are very important to state and local economies.&#13;
One of the controversial issues relating to shale gas production is the secrecy of toxic chemicals used for fracturing wells.5 Congress has adopted the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act under which persons have the right to know about hazardous chemicals used in their communities.6 However, the petroleum production industry secured an exception to this act under which they are able to decline to disclose the chemicals used at a well.7 Information about chemicals used at a site qualifies for trade secret protection. This means that drilling operators use dangerous chemicals in shale gas production in communities without disclosing what chemicals are present. Persons residing near well sites who are exposed to toxic constituents accompanying production activities have no idea what chemicals are being used.&#13;
It is estimated that companies are keeping at least one chemical secret in 65 percent of fracturing disclosures.8 The lack of sufficient information on chemicals poses risks and problems to emergency responders and people exposed to toxic substances. Because shale gas production activities involve releases of toxic chemicals and accidents happen, citizens are requesting greater disclosure of the chemicals being used. The current policy of trade secret protection is burdening health care providers and frustrating timely responses to harmful exposures of chemicals from fractured wells. Requiring&#13;
disclosure would support faster and more effective&#13;
cleanup efforts.9&#13;
The federal Bureau of Land Management proposed a new&#13;
federal rule in 2012 that would require the disclosure of&#13;
chemicals used in fracturing wells on public lands. Well operators&#13;
would be obligated to disclose the chemicals used&#13;
“after the fracturing operation is completed.”10 However, the&#13;
rule has been sent back to the agency for further consideration.&#13;
11&#13;
In the absence of a federal disclosure requirement, states&#13;
have adopted regulations on reporting chemicals used in&#13;
fracturing.12 The state requirements often include the disclosure&#13;
of chemicals used in fracturing on registry forms including&#13;
the identification of all chemical constituents and&#13;
associated Chemical Abstracts Service Numbers.13 Yet state&#13;
regulations allow firms not to divulge proprietary information&#13;
and trade secrets so that many drilling firms decline to&#13;
reveal the identities of some chemicals used in fracturing.14&#13;
Thus, nearby residents, emergency response personnel, and&#13;
medical professionals may be unable to properly respond to&#13;
releases of toxic substances from fracturing activities. Moreover,&#13;
nondisclosure may preclude long-term benefits such&#13;
as encouraging the development of more environmentallyfriendly&#13;
fracturing fluids15 and encouraging the reuse of produced&#13;
waters.16&#13;
B. Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations&#13;
Issues dealing with concentrated animal feeding operations&#13;
(CAFOs) continue to challenge regulators. In response to&#13;
the ruling in the National Pork Producers Council v. EPA&#13;
lawsuit,17 EPA adopted additional revisions to the water&#13;
quality permitting provisions of the CAFO rule in 2012.18&#13;
In contrast to the prompt legal challenges by environmental&#13;
and agribusiness groups after EPA issued its final CAFO&#13;
rules in 2003 and 2008, the 2012 CAFO rule has not been&#13;
immediately challenged.&#13;
However, challenges to CAFO regulations are occurring at&#13;
the state and local governmental levels, with one issue involving&#13;
whether livestock siting provisions adopted by state&#13;
legislatures preempt local controls. In Adams v. Wisconsin&#13;
Livestock Facilities Siting Review Board (2012), the Wisconsin&#13;
Supreme Court decided that the state siting law preempted&#13;
surface water quality controls of a town’s local ordinance.&#13;
19 The town could not impose additional requirements&#13;
in livestock facility siting permits because the state legislature&#13;
had withdrawn the power. This meant the town’s challenged&#13;
conditions were invalid.&#13;
Other states have also enacted legislation under which local&#13;
governments cannot impose additional nutrient management&#13;
conditions20 or local CAFO air pollution controls are invalid.&#13;
21 While state legislatures are able to enact comprehensive&#13;
systems to regulate CAFOs that preclude local regulation,&#13;
questions arise about the merits of this policy decision.&#13;
Because local governments have a function in responding&#13;
to citizen petitions concerning localized water and air pollution,&#13;
preemption of local ordinances might be used sparingly.&#13;
Some flexibility in enacting local ordinances to control&#13;
negative externalities at the local level may be prudent.&#13;
C. Pesticide Residues&#13;
Agricultural interest groups are seeking to exempt residues&#13;
of pesticides deposited in surface water from being regulated&#13;
under the Clean Water Act. In the United States, Congress&#13;
enacted the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide&#13;
Act (FIFRA) to oversee the manufacture, distribution,&#13;
and use of pesticides.22 Under FIFRA, EPA is responsible&#13;
for overseeing the registration, labeling, and use of pesticides.&#13;
The issue is whether the use of registered pesticides&#13;
that is accompanied by the deposition of some residues into&#13;
surface waters should be regulated by the water quality control&#13;
provisions of the Clean Water Act. The deposits of pesticide&#13;
residues may occur during aerial applications of pesticides&#13;
to control agricultural and forest pests as well as&#13;
disease-carrying mosquitoes.&#13;
Under the Clean Water Act, a National Pollutant Discharge&#13;
Elimination System (NPDES) program mandates a permitting&#13;
system to reduce pollutants entering surface water.23&#13;
This program requires persons discharging pollutants from&#13;
point sources to apply for an NPDES permit. Each permit&#13;
sets forth conditions and requirements for allowable discharges&#13;
to minimize amounts of pollutants entering surface&#13;
waters. In the National Cotton Council of America v. EPA&#13;
lawsuit, a federal court of appeals found that pesticides deposited&#13;
into navigable water were discharges of pollutants.24&#13;
Because the discharges were pollutants coming from a point source, they needed to be authorized under an NPDES permit.&#13;
EPA developed a new Pesticide General Permit in 2011 to&#13;
regulate deposits of pesticides into surface waters.25 Under&#13;
the Pesticide General Permit, an estimated 365,000 NPDES&#13;
permits are needed by pesticide applicators whose applications&#13;
deposit pesticides in navigable waters. Interest groups&#13;
representing agricultural and public health applicators have&#13;
objected to the requirement of an NPDES permit because&#13;
securing a permit is time consuming and costly. They seek&#13;
to amend federal law so that the permitting provisions of the&#13;
Clean Water Act would not apply for applications of pesticides&#13;
registered under FIFRA.26 Under the proposed legislation,&#13;
applications of pesticides could proceed without an&#13;
NPDES permit despite deposits of pesticides in surface waters.&#13;
An analysis of the regulatory provisions of FIFRA and the&#13;
Clean Water Act suggests that deposits of pesticides in surface&#13;
waters need to be regulated under the NPDES program.&#13;
FIFRA registration only considers overall damages and&#13;
thereby does not reveal damages associated with pesticide&#13;
concentrations and accumulations in specific public drinking&#13;
water sources. This means that FIFRA does not protect&#13;
humans or aquatic species from dangerous concentrations&#13;
of pesticides. Rather, NPDES permits are needed to oversee&#13;
unhealthy accumulations of pesticide residues in drinking&#13;
water supplies.&#13;
D. Applications of Biosolids to Land&#13;
The application of biosolids (also known as sewage sludge)&#13;
to agricultural lands remains controversial. Recent lawsuits&#13;
suggest that this use is becoming more acceptable and that&#13;
local governments may be limited on taking action to prevent&#13;
their application.&#13;
In a lawsuit from Pennsylvania, thirty-seven neighbors&#13;
sought to enjoin a defendant from applying biosolids to&#13;
farmland.27 Upon a motion for summary judgment by the&#13;
defendant, the court dismissed the case. The main argument&#13;
was that the application constituted a private nuisance due to&#13;
its extremely offensive odor. In analyzing the application of&#13;
biosolids, the court found the practice was an activity consistent&#13;
with technological development and qualified under&#13;
the definition of a “normal agricultural operation.” Under&#13;
the state’s anti-nuisance law (right-to-farm law), the plaintiffs&#13;
were barred from bringing the nuisance action. In the&#13;
absence of any justification, the plaintiffs did not qualify for&#13;
any injunctive relief. The defendant was able to continue&#13;
with applications of biosolids used as fertilizer.&#13;
A second case involved a municipal ordinance in California&#13;
that barred the application of biosolids in unincorporated&#13;
areas of a county.28 The plaintiff City of Los Angeles commenced&#13;
the litigation to invalidate the county’s ordinance so&#13;
the city could continue applying biosolids in the county. The&#13;
issue was whether the lower court erred in granting a preliminary&#13;
injunction that allowed biosolids to continue to be&#13;
applied. The appellate court found that it was likely that the&#13;
ordinance was preempted by the California Integrated Waste&#13;
Management Act.29 Moreover, the ordinance may conflict&#13;
with a state constitutional principle known as the “regional&#13;
welfare doctrine.” If the ordinance was preempted by state&#13;
law, it exceeded the authority of the county and would be invalid.&#13;
Thus, the court upheld the preliminary injunction that&#13;
precluded the ordinance from taking effect. The preemption&#13;
issue still needs to be decided by the judiciary.&#13;
E. Support for Biofuels Production&#13;
Commencing with the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the U.S.&#13;
Congress has sought to encourage renewable fuel production.&#13;
A renewable fuel standard program was established to&#13;
ensure that transportation fuel contains an increasing measure&#13;
of renewable fuel through 2022. Under federal law, the&#13;
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible&#13;
for establishing and implementing regulations to meet the&#13;
mandated biofuel volumes to achieve reductions in lifecycle&#13;
greenhouse gas emissions.30&#13;
The total renewable fuel requirement is divided into four&#13;
separate categories: total renewable fuels, advanced biofuels,&#13;
biomass-based diesel, and cellulosic biofuels. Each category&#13;
has its own yearly-volume requirement.31 The standards&#13;
for cellulosic biofuels projected in 2005 assumed&#13;
significant innovation in the industry, which has not been&#13;
forthcoming. Congress recognized the possibility of inadequate&#13;
supplies and provided an escape mechanism under&#13;
which EPA could reduce the applicable volume requirements&#13;
for a given year.32&#13;
Recent controversies have centered on the volume requirements&#13;
for the cellulosic and advanced biofuels standards set&#13;
by EPA. Less than expected imports of sugarcane ethanol&#13;
have made it difficult to meet the volume set for advanced&#13;
biofuels. Due to high production costs, there are inadequate&#13;
supplies of cellulosic biofuel to meet the volume established&#13;
by EPA. In 2013, a federal circuit court ruled that the 2012&#13;
projection of cellulosic biofuel production was in excess of&#13;
the agency’s authority and that aspect of the 2012 renewable&#13;
fuel standard rule was vacated.33&#13;
The U.S. policy on biofuels has been accompanied by unintended&#13;
and undesirable consequences for agricultural commodity&#13;
costs, fossil energy use, and environmental degradation.&#13;
The most notable concern is that the use of food crops&#13;
for biofuels has led to higher corn (maize) prices. Due to the&#13;
high costs of production, some feel that the U.S. biofuels industry&#13;
will not be able to meet the expanding mandate for&#13;
biofuels from non-corn sources or biomass-produced biodiesel.&#13;
34 In September 2013, the American Petroleum Institute launched a campaign against the provisions of the renewable&#13;
fuel standard claiming it has too many negative impacts.&#13;
3. Agricultural Aspects of the Food&#13;
Chain&#13;
Regulations continue to be important to production and marketing&#13;
aspects of food production. Safety concerns about&#13;
feeding food animals the feed additive ractopamine have&#13;
created a controversy regarding meat exports. Vocal members&#13;
of the public are also advancing ideas on food safety,&#13;
obesity, and other issues.&#13;
A. Meat Production Using Feed Additives&#13;
With the decision in 2012 by Codex to advance a residue&#13;
limit for ractopamine hydrochloride by a 69-67 vote, disagreement&#13;
has arisen about the use of this controversial veterinary&#13;
drug in food animal production.35 Ractopamine is&#13;
used as a feed additive to promote leanness in pigs, cattle,&#13;
and turkeys raised for meat. Pharmacologically, it is a betaadrenoceptor&#13;
agonist, and was developed by Elanco Animal&#13;
Health, a division of Eli Lilly and Company. For cattle, ractopamine&#13;
is the active ingredient in Optaflexx®. It does not&#13;
affect the hormone status of the animal and is generally only&#13;
used during the last month of the finishing period to reduce&#13;
fat deposits.36 For pigs, ractopamine is the active ingredient&#13;
in Paylean®. Paylean® helps release fat in pigs to make nutrients&#13;
available for muscle growth. For turkeys, Topmax®&#13;
is used.&#13;
The EU, China, and Russia prohibit the use of ractopamine&#13;
for food animal production. The Chinese fear that higher&#13;
concentrations of ractopamine in pig organs, a part of a traditional&#13;
Chinese diet, may be unhealthy.37 With Russia’s recent&#13;
ban on U.S. beef, pork, and turkey products due to residues&#13;
of ractopamine, U.S. congressmen have requested the&#13;
U.S. Trade Representative to address the zero tolerance level&#13;
as inconsistent with the World Trade Organization’s Sanitary&#13;
and Phytosanitary Agreement. American producers argue&#13;
that the Codex maximum residue limit means American&#13;
meat products are safe and the preclusion of U.S. products is&#13;
a violation of international treaties.&#13;
In 2009, an EU Panel on Additives and Products or Substances&#13;
used in Animal Feed reported to the European Food&#13;
and Safety Authority that “ractopamine is not mutagenic and&#13;
is unlikely to present a carcinogenic risk to consumers.”38&#13;
Yet the report did express concern about the absence of sufficient&#13;
studies on the effects of ractopamine on humans. The&#13;
European Commission issued a statement on ractopamine&#13;
maintaining that its risk assessment body has concluded that&#13;
there is insufficient data upon which to make a proposal for&#13;
maximum residue levels.39 Due to unresolved safety concerns,&#13;
the EU’s current legislation remains in place that bans&#13;
the use of ractopamine.&#13;
In the United States, Smithfield Foods, the largest pork producer&#13;
that is being bought by China’s largest meat company,&#13;
announced that one-half of its production will be ractopamine-&#13;
free by 1 June 2013.40 Further consumer pressure may&#13;
lead more American firms to adopt production contracts under&#13;
which producers are precluded from using this feed additive.&#13;
B. Food Safety&#13;
The addition of caffeine to a range of foods and beverages&#13;
has led to health concerns and prompted federal, state, and&#13;
local regulatory actions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#13;
is investigating the health implications of these practices,&#13;
particularly those involving foods and beverages targeted&#13;
to children and adolescents.41 Caffeinated products&#13;
include chewing gum, candy, snacks (“Cracker Jack’d”), instant&#13;
oatmeal, waffles, waffle/pancake syrup, energy drinks,&#13;
and alcoholic beverages.&#13;
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, caffeinerelated&#13;
health concerns include cardiovascular, neurological,&#13;
and psychological problems (e.g., increased blood pressure,&#13;
sleep disturbances, and anxiety).42 Health concerns among&#13;
adults include sleep disturbances, such as those reported&#13;
among the U.S. military.43 In the United States between January&#13;
1, 2004 and October 23, 2012, at least 18 deaths were&#13;
linked to energy drinks with caffeine.44 Caffeine content&#13;
varies considerably among energy drinks and caffeine may not necessarily be listed on the ingredient label when the&#13;
caffeine is derived from a botanical source.45&#13;
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade&#13;
Commission, and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade&#13;
Bureau have notified several companies producing alcoholic&#13;
beverages with added caffeine that these beverages present&#13;
unusual risks to public health and safety. Thus, the products&#13;
are being reviewed to determine if they are adulterated&#13;
under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and, therefore,&#13;
mislabeled under the Federal Alcohol Administration&#13;
Act.46&#13;
Another food safety issue involves consumer sales of raw&#13;
milk. Due to federal regulations, raw milk cannot be sold&#13;
in another state,47 but states are free to allow the sale and&#13;
consumption of raw milk within their borders. Raw milk is&#13;
credited with improving health48 and offering increased resistance&#13;
to allergies and asthma. Although statistics disclose&#13;
health risks associated with the consumption of raw milk,49&#13;
a vocal subsection of the public continues to petition state&#13;
legislatures to allow the sale of raw milk. Despite appeals to&#13;
prevent harm, approximately one-half of the U.S. states allow&#13;
the sale of unpasteurized raw milk to consumers within&#13;
their borders.50&#13;
C. Obesity&#13;
Among more than 40 countries, the U.S. ranked second&#13;
among children aged 15 to 17 years and first among adults&#13;
in the prevalence of overweight and obesity.51 Strategies to&#13;
reverse the obesity epidemic include policy and regulatory&#13;
approaches to decreasing energy (calorie) intake. Initiatives&#13;
aimed at improving healthy food choices among children&#13;
include the Healthy Hunger-free Kids Act52 that mandates&#13;
improvements in the National School Lunch and School&#13;
Breakfast Programs and competitive foods (foods and beverages&#13;
sold in vending machines and other venues outside&#13;
the school cafeteria), and policies regarding food marketing&#13;
aimed at children and youth.53&#13;
There are numerous challenges in regulating marketing, including&#13;
considerable protection of free speech to U.S. corporations&#13;
including the food and beverage industries.54 In&#13;
June 2013, the American Medical Association recommended&#13;
that obesity be recognized as a disease.55 The extent to&#13;
which this designation will change current strategies for&#13;
obesity prevention and treatment by the medical community,&#13;
public health system, food and beverage industry, and general&#13;
public is under debate.&#13;
D. Organic Products and Pesticide Residues&#13;
Applications of pesticides sometimes adversely affect nearby&#13;
organic farmers. In 2012, the Minnesota Supreme Court&#13;
had an opportunity to consider allegations of trespass and&#13;
nuisance from pesticide spray drift in Johnson v. Paynesville&#13;
Farmers Union Cooperative Oil Company.56 The court dismissed&#13;
the trespass claim because Minnesota law traditionally&#13;
required “some physical, tangible agency” that was not&#13;
present when intangible spray drift entered the plaintiff’s&#13;
property. The court concluded that “trespass claims address&#13;
tangible invasions of the right to exclusive possession of&#13;
land, and nuisance claims address invasions of the right to&#13;
use and enjoyment of land.” The court noted that the interference&#13;
with the plaintiffs’ use and enjoyment of their land&#13;
could constitute a nuisance.&#13;
The Minnesota court went on to evaluate whether the defendant’s&#13;
application of pesticides constituted a violation&#13;
of the federal National Organic Program regulations.57 The&#13;
court determined that the federal regulations do not require&#13;
an organic farmer to remove a field from production merely&#13;
because pesticide residues are present as a result of drift.&#13;
Rather, the regulations provide that crops cannot be sold if&#13;
residue testing shows prohibited substances at levels that are&#13;
greater than 5 percent of the tolerance for the specific residue.&#13;
58 If an organic operation follows all the rules of production&#13;
yet errant residues are found on the crop, the residues&#13;
do not disqualify the organic status unless a residue&#13;
exceeds the tolerance level set forth in the federal rules.&#13;
With this ruling, there is greater confusion about the qualifications&#13;
for the organic label in the United States.&#13;
E. Pesticide-Sensitive Persons&#13;
A few state legislatures have responded to concerns about&#13;
pesticide spray drift damages by enacting a registry for pesticide-sensitive persons and delineating notification requirements.&#13;
59 In Colorado, persons are able to request their physician&#13;
to certify that they have a documented sensitivity to&#13;
pesticides and should not be exposed to them.60 Persons&#13;
submit this information with their address to the state registry&#13;
along with the addresses of properties that abut their residence.&#13;
61 The Colorado regulations prescribe obligations for&#13;
pesticide applicators to provide notice to sensitive persons&#13;
listed on the registry prior to an application of a pesticide.&#13;
4. Other Issues Affecting Rural America&#13;
Americans are also expressing concerns about genetically&#13;
modified organisms, country of origin labeling, and the issue&#13;
of fraudulent employment to gain evidence of offensive animal&#13;
production practices.&#13;
A. Product Labeling Regarding Genetically&#13;
Modified Ingredients&#13;
Food labeling that is false or misleading is generally prohibited&#13;
under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Food labeling&#13;
is misleading if it fails to reveal material facts. Because&#13;
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers&#13;
foods with genetically-modified (GM) ingredients to be substantially&#13;
similar to conventional foods, it has declined to&#13;
impose labeling requirements on GM food products.62 However,&#13;
the agency is considering consumer petitions on the issue.&#13;
Meanwhile, interest groups are proposing state legislation&#13;
to require the labeling of products with genetically-modified&#13;
ingredients. In 2012, California voters rejected Proposition&#13;
37 that would have required GM labeling. In 2013, the&#13;
legislatures of Connecticut and Maine passed geneticallyengineered&#13;
food labeling laws.63 However, the labeling provisions&#13;
will not become effective unless there is sufficient&#13;
support from other states.&#13;
B. Country of Origin Labeling&#13;
In response to a World Trade Organization ruling, the U.S.&#13;
Country of Origin Labeling for muscle cut meat commodities&#13;
needed to be revised. The U.S. Department of Agriculture&#13;
adopted a new rule in May 2013 that addressed the previous&#13;
problems to provide more specific information.64 The&#13;
new rule eliminates the allowance for commingling of muscle&#13;
cuts of beef, veal, pork, lamb, goat, and chicken meats&#13;
having different origins. Retail full-line grocery stores, supermarkets,&#13;
and club warehouse stores must provide their&#13;
customers with information regarding the source of certain&#13;
foods including muscle cut and ground meats, wild&#13;
and farm-raised fish and shellfish, fresh and frozen fruits&#13;
and vegetables, peanuts, pecans, macadamia nuts, and ginseng.&#13;
Livestock groups from the U.S. and Canada have commenced&#13;
a lawsuit to strike down the meat labeling provisions.&#13;
65&#13;
C. Undercover Investigations: “Ag Gag” Laws&#13;
Agricultural groups have been advocating new legislation&#13;
known as “ag gag” laws to deal with animal-rights activists&#13;
who pose as employees and obtain pictures and video&#13;
footage of animal abuse and health-code violations.66 The&#13;
negative publicity and falsification of conditions at animal&#13;
production facilities by the undercover investigators have&#13;
affronted producers and have created adverse financial consequences.&#13;
The agricultural interest groups want a stronger&#13;
law that provides penalties for obtaining access to an agricultural&#13;
operation under false pretenses.67 Producers feel&#13;
they need additional legal protection in the form of criminalization&#13;
of undercover photography and videotaping.&#13;
The proposed and existing ag gag laws are controversial for&#13;
a number of reasons. First, some argue they are not needed&#13;
because obtaining a job under false pretenses is already&#13;
actionable under state laws addressing fraud. Second, some&#13;
feel that the freedom of speech protects the rights of persons&#13;
to communicate sights they see while on a job. Moreover, a&#13;
state government should not discourage the disclosure of animal&#13;
abuse or bad production practices. Third, good animal&#13;
production facilities should have nothing to hide. The ag&#13;
gag provisions are not needed. Rather, there is concern that&#13;
the laws offer protection to facilities that engage in abusive&#13;
practices. Public opposition has precluded a number of state&#13;
legislatures from adopting proposed ag gag laws.68&#13;
5. Conclusory Comments&#13;
Americans remain concerned about environmental quality&#13;
in rural areas and are becoming more concerned about their&#13;
food supplies. Interest groups continue to advance their proposals&#13;
in Congress as well as state legislatures. Given the inability&#13;
for most federal initiatives to be adopted, a majority&#13;
of the new legislation affecting agriculture is at the state&#13;
level.&#13;
The last several years have seen a flurry of developments at&#13;
the state level to oversee activities connected with hydraulic&#13;
fracturing for oil and gas deposits. New state laws and regulations&#13;
offer greater protection to people and the environment&#13;
by addressing risks that may lead to damages. Yet due&#13;
to concerns about cumulative adverse health effects from&#13;
chemicals used in fracturing, stronger regulatory controls&#13;
may be needed. A major issue involves trade secret protection&#13;
for the toxic chemicals used at wells. The secrecy of toxic chemicals used at gas wells creates hazards for first responders&#13;
and others affected by accidents. Rural residents&#13;
are also concerned about property values and the quality of&#13;
agricultural irrigation water.&#13;
In 2011, EPA adopted a final rule attempting to regulate pesticide&#13;
residues in surface waters. This rule is important because&#13;
it will preclude accumulations of multiple pesticides&#13;
in drinking waters that may adversely affect aquatic invertebrates&#13;
and vertebrates69 or may adversely affect persons ingesting&#13;
pesticide residues in drinking water.70 A few states&#13;
have already adopted provisions covering applications of biological&#13;
and chemical pesticides in, over, or near water.71&#13;
However, forestry and agricultural groups are advancing a&#13;
proposal known as the “Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act&#13;
of 2013” to exempt qualifying pesticide applications from&#13;
NPDES permitting provisions.72&#13;
With the Codex vote in 2012 to advance a residue limit for&#13;
ractopamine, U.S. producers are anxious for foreign markets&#13;
to become more open to meat products from the United&#13;
States. Additional controversies with the EU, Russia, and&#13;
China on this issue may be expected. Yet, due to marketing&#13;
strategies, firms selling meat products may preclude producers&#13;
from using feed additives. Turning to the labeling of GM&#13;
products, attitudes of Americans seem to be changing. A few&#13;
states are considering legislation requiring the labeling of&#13;
GM products. Americans are also becoming more knowledgeable&#13;
about the obesity problem and caffeine-related&#13;
health concerns. Interest groups and regulators will continue&#13;
with efforts to address the problems posed by many Americans&#13;
who are overweight.</content><legacyfootnotes>* Professors, The University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA.
