inherently risky. US agricultural operations face production&#13;
risks from the vagaries of weather, disease and pests, as well&#13;
as financial risks from changing economic conditions,&#13;
including market prices and cost of production. In&#13;
addition, government policies, enacted in laws and&#13;
regulations, affect farmers and influence their business&#13;
decisions. Producers often adopt management strategies to&#13;
reduce their risks. Among these strategies is diversification&#13;
of the farm enterprise. Diversification offers advantages&#13;
because ‘incomes from different crops and livestock&#13;
activities do not move up and down in perfect correlation,&#13;
so that low income from some activities would likely be&#13;
offset by higher income from others.’1&#13;
Though the term ‘diversification’ is not defined by statute&#13;
in the US, it encompasses nontraditional agricultural&#13;
products, activities, or land uses. Diversification includes&#13;
production that targets niche markets or satisfies a growing&#13;
demand for organic products, land uses that mitigate&#13;
environmental impact, and other activities that allow the&#13;
farmer to earn income from a nontraditional source. Valueadded&#13;
processing and packaging of traditional products,&#13;
production of nontraditional crops or livestock, new&#13;
methods of marketing (eg, direct or internet), and many&#13;
types of agritourism are common ways that farmers&#13;
diversify.2 In a 2009 speech, the US Secretary of Agriculture&#13;
encouraged diversification. Noting that federal farm&#13;
program payments have been criticized both globally and&#13;
nationally and may therefore be at risk, he recommended&#13;
that producers consider supplementing their income by&#13;
other activities – eg, organic production, biofuels, or&#13;
windmills.3&#13;
The complexities and costs associated with changes in&#13;
production have prompted federal and state governments to&#13;
create programs that assist or encourage some types of&#13;
diversification. In addition, producers have access to&#13;
significant resources to facilitate diversification. The US&#13;
Department of Agriculture (USDA), for example, identifies&#13;
sources of information about diversification, accompanied&#13;
by an extensive list of possible crops, livestock, and farm&#13;
enterprises.4 The Sustainable Agriculture Network suggests&#13;
economical ways to diversify cropping systems.5 Some states&#13;
also provide helpful information.6 These programs and&#13;
information sources help to advance and promote socially&#13;
desirable activities, including organic production,&#13;
conservation, recreation, and community supported&#13;
marketing arrangements.&#13;
This article focuses on legal incentives and legal obstacles to&#13;
diversification in the US. It first outlines some farm&#13;
characteristics that may influence diversification. It then&#13;
turns to the possible impact of the agricultural tenancy&#13;
relationship on diversification and the relevance of land-use&#13;
restrictions and other laws for the producer who plans to&#13;
undertake a new activity. The article then discusses a&#13;
number of activities that are typical of farm diversification&#13;
in the US, with an emphasis on federal government&#13;
programs that support diversification. These activities&#13;
include organic production, alternative crops and livestock,&#13;
marketing strategies, agritourism, conservation, and&#13;
production of renewable energy.</inleiding><content>1. Factors in Diversification&#13;
1.1. Farm Characteristics&#13;
Diversification in the US is influenced by farm&#13;
characteristics and often attracts small-scale producers.&#13;
According to USDA, a farm is any place from which&#13;
$1,000 or more of agricultural products were produced or&#13;
sold during the year. USDA categorizes farms by level of&#13;
sales. Small family farms have gross sales lower than&#13;
$250,000 and include both rural-residence farms and&#13;
intermediate farms. Rural residence farms are retirement&#13;
farms and residential/lifestyle farms with a major&#13;
occupation other than farming. Intermediate family farms&#13;
include low-sales farms (gross sales lower than $100,000)&#13;
and high-sales farms (sales between $100,000 and&#13;
$249,999). Large family farms are commercial farms, either&#13;
large (gross sales between $250,000 and $499,999) or very&#13;
large (gross sales over $500,000).7 Though most US farms&#13;
are family farms, a small percentage are nonfamily farms&#13;
with the majority of the business owned by nonrelated&#13;
individuals.&#13;
The 2007 Census of Agriculture, released in early 2009,&#13;
indicated that the US had a total of 2,204,792 farms&#13;
(76,000 more than in 2002); land in farms was 922.1&#13;
million acres (373.5 million hectares), with an average farm&#13;
size of 418 acres (169.3 hectares).8 Relying on that Census,&#13;
the US Secretary of Agriculture noted some troubling&#13;
changes in the demographics of US farms. Since 2002, the&#13;
numbers of both small and large farms have grown. For&#13;
example, farms with sales less than $2,500 increased by&#13;
74,000, and farms with sales over $500,000 increased by&#13;
46,000. Farms with sales between $10,000 and $500,000,&#13;
however, declined by 80,000. The largest 125,000 US&#13;
farms, only about 5 percent of the total, produced 75&#13;
percent of food products in 2007.9&#13;
1.1.1. Farm-Related Activities&#13;
Not all farm income comes from traditional farm&#13;
production. ‘Farm-related’ activities, which generate&#13;
income from use of farm assets for nonproduction&#13;
activities, are financially significant, especially for farms&#13;
selling less than $50,000 annually. Many farm-related&#13;
activities reflect diversification. These include ‘sales of farm&#13;
output and value-added products directly to consumers,&#13;
on-farm energy production, running an on-farm recreation&#13;
business (agrotourism), and forest product sales.’10 The&#13;
USDA tracks farm-related income. In 2007, for example,&#13;
direct sales to consumers through farmers markets, roadside&#13;
stands and pick-your-own operations amounted to $1&#13;
billion. About 5 percent of all farms sold directly, and more&#13;
than 80 percent of these were small farms (sales under&#13;
$50,000).11 Agritourism also generated significant farmrelated&#13;
income.&#13;
1.1.2. Off-Farm Income&#13;
The majority of farms in the US do not produce enough&#13;
income from agriculture to support the farm family. Offfarm&#13;
income has increased steadily since the 1960s, and&#13;
recent data indicates that off-farm employment provides&#13;
nearly 80 percent of farm household income.12 In fact, of&#13;
the 2.2 million farmers or ranchers included in the 2007&#13;
Census of Agriculture, 900,000 perform off-farm work 200&#13;
days per year.13 That is, the farm operator, not a spouse,&#13;
spends a major portion of his or her working time off the&#13;
farm. Moreover, about 70 percent of farm operator&#13;
households have a farmer or spouse working off the farm.&#13;
Only on farms with sales of more than $250,000 per year&#13;
(the largest 8 percent) does farm income exceed off-farm&#13;
income.14 As the US Secretary of Agriculture noted, these&#13;
statistics ‘may explain why 60 percent of America’s farms&#13;
have less than $10,000 in sales.’15&#13;
1.2. Farm Tenancy&#13;
Tenancy is significant in US agriculture. The 2007 Census&#13;
of Agriculture indicates that 69 percent of farms are&#13;
operated by full owners, 24.6 percent by part owners, and 6.4 percent by tenants. Census data makes clear, however,&#13;
that full owners operate the smallest farms, with an average&#13;
size of 226 acres (107.8 hectares); more than 1 million of&#13;
the 1.5 million full-ownership farms produce less than&#13;
$10,000 (market value and government payments) per year.&#13;
The largest farms with highest production include rented&#13;
land. The average farm size for part owners was 915 acres&#13;
(370.6 hectares) and for full tenants, 582 acres (235.7&#13;
hectares). A significant majority of these part-owner and&#13;
full-tenant farms produced more than $10,000, and many&#13;
produced more than $500,000.16&#13;
In the US, states govern most aspects of the landlord-tenant&#13;
relationship. State statutes and common-law principles&#13;
regulate some aspects of farm leasing, particularly lease&#13;
termination and remedies for breach of lease contracts.17&#13;
Long-term leases of farmland, though legally permissible,&#13;
are unusual in the US; state statutes do not require specific&#13;
lengths for lease terms. Short-term leases (often one year)&#13;
are common, and no automatic right of renewal exists. The&#13;
lease can be terminated without justification by landlord or&#13;
tenant at the end of a lease term, provided that notice, if&#13;
required by state law or contract, is timely. In practice,&#13;
however, many tenants farm the same rented land for long&#13;
periods of time.&#13;
Landowners and tenants enjoy considerable freedom of&#13;
contract. Under a typical farm lease, the tenant is in&#13;
possession and control of the land for the lease term. Unless&#13;
the lease provides otherwise, the tenant determines the&#13;
cropping system. Leases can, and often do, include&#13;
provisions that permit or prohibit specific land uses on the&#13;
rented farm. Many leases provide that the tenant must farm&#13;
in a ‘husbandlike’ manner, follow accepted conservation&#13;
practices, and avoid committing waste (that is, willful or&#13;
negligent destruction of the leased property). In practice,&#13;
landowner and tenant often cooperate closely in making&#13;
management decisions about crop production and&#13;
conservation, especially in a crop-share lease, under which&#13;
the landlord’s rent is a percentage of the crop. Under a cash&#13;
lease, the landowner may be less involved in the farming&#13;
operation.&#13;
Thus, the tenant’s ability to diversify the farming operation&#13;
will depend in large part on the terms of the farm lease.&#13;
Unless the lease specifies the cropping system or imposes&#13;
other restrictions, the tenant will be free to plant specialty&#13;
crops or carry out other nontraditional agricultural&#13;
activities. The tenant whose plan for diversification involve&#13;
significant changes in the farming operation would be wise&#13;
to secure the agreement of the landowner, particularly if a&#13;
new activity requires construction or alteration of&#13;
structures. Without an express agreement from the&#13;
landowner, the tenant may not have the right to receive&#13;
compensation for permanent improvements made to the&#13;
farm property. Also, because leases are often for one year&#13;
and can be terminated easily, a landowner who disapproves&#13;
of the tenant’s new activities can terminate the lease at the&#13;
end of the term. Moreover, the profitability of some new&#13;
activities (eg, organic production) requires a lease with a&#13;
longer term than the typical one-year farm lease.&#13;
Participation in federal farm programs on rented land will&#13;
depend both on the lease terms and on the requirements of&#13;
the particular program. The decision to participate in&#13;
government programs may be a matter of contract, if the&#13;
lease addresses that subject. For example, a crop-share lease&#13;
form used in Illinois states that ‘Lessor and Tenant shall&#13;
decide each year whether to enter into governmental&#13;
programs designed to aid agriculture and how payments for&#13;
doing so and the cost involved shall be shared between&#13;
them.’18&#13;
Federal farm programs often protect both tenants and&#13;
sharecroppers, and regulations may give specific guidance.&#13;
In some instances the type of lease (cash or crop share)&#13;
determines how government payments should be divided.&#13;
For direct or counter-cyclical payments under US&#13;
agricultural legislation, for example, the landlord under a&#13;
cash lease is not eligible for payments, but under a cropshare&#13;
lease, neither landlord nor tenant may receive 100&#13;
percent of the payments. Moreover, payments cannot be&#13;
made if the owner or operator has terminated a lease in&#13;
violation of state law or has acted to deprive a tenant or&#13;
sharecropper of payments that he or she would otherwise be&#13;
entitled to receive.19 Federal regulations often require&#13;
signatures of both landowner and tenant for enrollment of&#13;
land in conservation programs.20&#13;
1.3. Land Use Regulation&#13;
In the US, land use is generally a matter of local control.&#13;
Although state-wide land use planning exists in a few states,&#13;
most states delegate the power to zone to local authorities –&#13;
counties and municipalities. Some jurisdictions have&#13;
enacted agricultural protection zoning, which limits land&#13;
uses, particularly activities incompatible with agriculture, in&#13;
agricultural zones. The majority of rural land, however, is&#13;
not zoned.&#13;
The issue for diversification of activities on a farm,&#13;
however, is whether zoning regulations will prohibit or&#13;
impose restrictions on a nontraditional activity. ‘Whether a&#13;
particular use enjoys exemption from regulation under a&#13;
zoning ordinance depends first on what immunities are&#13;
afforded agricultural or farming operations by state statute,&#13;
normally included in the zoning enabling statute, and then&#13;
on what type of zoning district encompasses the particular&#13;
tract of land upon which the new activity is to be undertaken.’21 Farmers who plan to diversify have faced&#13;
obstacles from zoning ordinances; in some instances&#13;
litigation, sometimes focused on whether the proposed&#13;
activity was agriculture or a farm, has resulted.22&#13;
When an activity is clearly agricultural and carried out in a&#13;
rural area, land use regulation is unlikely to pose obstacles to&#13;
diversification. In fact, some jurisdictions restrict the power&#13;
of zoning officials to govern agricultural activities. In&#13;
Illinois, for example, counties have authority to regulate and&#13;
restrict location and use of structures through zoning.&#13;
County zoning authority may not be exercised to ‘impose&#13;
regulations, eliminate uses, buildings, or structures, or&#13;
require permits with respect to land used for agricultural&#13;
purposes.’23 Counties may require agricultural buildings and&#13;
structures to comply with building or set-back lines, and&#13;
counties may establish a minimum lot size for residences on&#13;
agricultural land. Other states have similar provisions.24&#13;
When an activity carried out on rural land is not clearly&#13;
agricultural, however, county and municipal zoning&#13;
regulations may impose requirements. For example,&#13;
operation of a farm stand that sells produce directly to&#13;
customers may not be considered agriculture, and local&#13;
ordinances often govern the location and operation of such&#13;
roadside stands. In some states, however, statutes protect&#13;
diverse activities related to agriculture from zoning&#13;
restrictions. A Massachusetts statute, for example, limits the&#13;
regulation of agricultural activities, ‘including those&#13;
facilities for the sale of produce, wine and dairy products’&#13;
under certain conditions.25 Thus, the producer who plans&#13;
to diversify the farm business must be sure that the&#13;
proposed activity will comply with local land use&#13;
restrictions.26&#13;
1.4. Other Regulation&#13;
When farmers diversify their operations, many&#13;
nontraditional activities will continue to involve&#13;
agriculture. The farmer who uses organic production,&#13;
cultivates specialty crops, or raises nontraditional livestock&#13;
will still be engaged in agriculture. Some states specifically&#13;
define diverse activities, including selling products and&#13;
agritourism, as agriculture when performed on the farm.27&#13;
In these situations, the farmer’s legal obligations may not&#13;
change significantly.&#13;
The determination that a diversified activity of a farm&#13;
operation is not agriculture, however, may have legal&#13;
implications. A number of federal and state laws have&#13;
special provisions (often helpful exemptions) for&#13;
agriculture, and these provisions may not apply to the&#13;
nonagricultural part of the farmer’s diversified operation.&#13;
Bankruptcy law, for example, has provisions that apply&#13;
specifically to farmers. Under the Bankruptcy Code28, a&#13;
‘farmer’ is a person who received more than 80 percent of&#13;
gross income in the prior year from a farming operation,&#13;
and a ‘family farmer’ receives at least 50 percent of gross&#13;
income from a farming operation. A ‘farming operation’&#13;
includes ‘farming, tillage of the soil, dairy farming,&#13;
ranching, production or raising of crops, poultry, or&#13;
livestock, and production of poultry or livestock products&#13;
in an unmanufactured state.’29 Activities that do not fit in&#13;
this definition of farming operation may affect eligibility&#13;
for certain provisions of the Code. For example, both&#13;
farmers and family farmers are protected from involuntary&#13;
bankruptcy (cases brought by creditors), and that&#13;
protection may be lost.30 Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy&#13;
Code, designed for family farmers with regular annual&#13;
income, tailors reorganization to the economic situation of&#13;
farmers. The producer whose diversification takes activities&#13;
out of the definition of farming operation may be ineligible&#13;
for the advantages of Chapter 12.31&#13;
A number of federal labor laws have special provisions that&#13;
apply to agriculture. For example, under the Fair Labor&#13;
Standards Act32, minimum wage requirements do not apply&#13;
to employees in agriculture who work on small farms.&#13;
‘Agriculture’ is defined broadly to include ‘farming in all its&#13;
branches ... , and any practices ... performed by a farmer or&#13;
on a farm as an incident to or in conjunction with such&#13;
farming operations, including preparation for market,&#13;
delivery to storage or to market.’33 Some types of diversified&#13;
activities (eg, direct sales to consumers) may not be&#13;
considered agriculture and may trigger minimum wage&#13;
requirements. Other federal labor laws with special&#13;
provisions for agriculture may raise similar issues.34&#13;
State laws, too, often include special provisions for agricultural employment. When an activity is not&#13;
agricultural, benefits of those provisions will be lost, and&#13;
some activities may require licenses or permits. Workers’&#13;
compensations laws, which compensate employees injured&#13;
in the scope of employment, are an example. In Illinois, for&#13;
example, most employers must provide workers’&#13;
compensation insurance for employees. But the workers’&#13;
compensation law does not apply to ‘any agricultural&#13;
enterprise, including aquaculture,’ that employed fewer&#13;
than 400 working days of agricultural labor per quarter&#13;
during the prior year. The law does apply, however, to any&#13;
enterprise that serves food to the public, or sells goods to&#13;
the public and has an annual payroll of more than&#13;
$1,000.35 Some diversified activities (eg, recreational use,&#13;
hospitality, direct sales) will therefore trigger application of&#13;
workers’ compensation requirements.&#13;
2. Organic Agriculture&#13;
In the US, organic production has increased significantly&#13;
since the late 1990s, and sales of organic foods reached&#13;
$21.1 billion in 2008. Organic sales are about 3 percent of&#13;
total food, but organic foods have reached the mainstream;&#13;
in 2008, 69 percent of consumers purchased organic&#13;
products, although prices for organic products are usually&#13;
higher than for conventional products.36 About 1.6 million&#13;
US hectares were managed as certified organic land in&#13;
200537, more than twice the level in 1997. Nonetheless,&#13;
certified organic land amounted to only 0.5 percent of&#13;
cropland (0.2 percent of US maize and soy crops) and 0.5&#13;
percent of pasture land; almost 5 percent of vegetable and&#13;
2.5 percent of fruit and nut acreage were managed&#13;
organically. Organic farms are often smaller than&#13;
conventional farms and market their products directly.38&#13;
2.1. Support for Organic Production&#13;
Federal government programs have helped to encourage&#13;
growth of organic production. A cost share program helps&#13;
producers and handlers of organic products to obtain&#13;
certification under the National Organic Program&#13;
(discussed below).39 The 2008 Farm Bill40, which increased&#13;
funding for organic agriculture significantly, added new&#13;
provisions to facilitate organic production. For example, the&#13;
Environmental Quality Incentives Program now authorizes&#13;
direct financial support for conservation practices related to&#13;
organic production and transition to organic production.&#13;
Producers must carry out an organic plan approved under&#13;
the National Organic Program and develop and implement&#13;
appropriate conservation practices. Producers may receive&#13;
$20,000 per year, with a maximum of $80,000 over six&#13;
years41, and they may also receive technical assistance for&#13;
conservation practices. In May 2009, USDA announced&#13;
the availability of $50 million (allocated to states by&#13;
formula) under the 2009 Organic Initiative. Eligibility was&#13;
open to farmers making the transition to certified organic&#13;
production and certified organic farmers adding organic&#13;
acres or herds or adopting additional conservation&#13;
measures.42&#13;
The 2008 Farm Bill included other support for organic&#13;
agriculture, including mandatory funding for the&#13;
certification cost-share program, funds for collection of data&#13;
on organic production43, and a large increase in mandatory&#13;
research funds. Priority research includes conservation and&#13;
environmental effects of organic production (including&#13;
carbon storage) and development of seed varieties.44&#13;
2.2. Organic Certification&#13;
Products certified as organic must meet stringent&#13;
production standards. The US Organic Food Production&#13;
Act45, enacted in 1990, provides that farmers cannot label a&#13;
product as organic, or imply that a product is organic,&#13;
unless they follow federal guidelines.46 The law establishes a&#13;
certification program, under which certifying agents,&#13;
accredited by the USDA, ensure that statutory and&#13;
regulatory requirements are met. State and private organic&#13;
certification programs must be at least as strict as federal&#13;
standards, and some are stricter.47&#13;
The National Organic Standards Board, established in the&#13;
1990 law, promulgated comprehensive national standards,48&#13;
effective in 2002. Under the National Organic Program&#13;
(NOP), specified substances, methods (including genetic&#13;
engineering), and ingredients are prohibited in organic crop&#13;
production and handling. Products labeled ‘100 percent&#13;
organic’ or ‘organic’ (at least 95 percent organically produced ingredients) or ‘made with organic ingredients’&#13;
(at least 70 percent) may not use excluded methods.49&#13;
Process standards for organic certification require the&#13;
producer to follow an approved organic system plan,&#13;
normally with ‘management practices and physical barriers’&#13;
to avoid unintentional contact with unapproved&#13;
substances.50 Organic producers must use ‘distinct, defined&#13;
boundaries and buffer zones such as runoff diversions to&#13;
prevent the unintended application of a prohibited&#13;
substance to the crop or contact with a prohibited&#13;
substance applied to adjoining land that is not under&#13;
organic management.’51 Those who handle organic&#13;
products must also ‘prevent the commingling of organic&#13;
and nonorganic products and protect organic products&#13;
from contact with prohibited substances.’52&#13;
NOP standards also apply to organically-produced&#13;
livestock.53With a few exceptions, ‘[l]ivestock products that&#13;
are to be sold, labeled, or represented as organic must be&#13;
from livestock under continuous organic management from&#13;
the last third of gestation or hatching.’54 Feed for livestock&#13;
sold as organic must generally be produced organically, and&#13;
the producer must not use animal drugs to promote&#13;
growth.55 Moreover, a farmer who raises organic livestock&#13;
must ensure that livestock living conditions ‘accommodate&#13;
the health and natural behavior of animals.’56&#13;
A small farmer or handling operation, whose annual organic&#13;
sales are $5,000 or less, can sell products as organic without&#13;
following all federal organic requirements. The small farmer&#13;
must follow production, handling, and labeling require -&#13;
ments, but is exempt from certification and need not submit&#13;
an organic system plan.57 This exemption is significant in&#13;
light of the number of small farms in the US.&#13;
3. Alternative Crops and Livestock&#13;
Some diversified producers raise nontraditional crops and&#13;
livestock. USDA has complied a lengthy list of alternative&#13;
crops and livestock and helpful information for producers.&#13;
Alternative crops include numerous nontraditional field&#13;
crops as well as specialty vegetables, fruits and nuts, and&#13;
horticultural or nursery products, and forestry products.&#13;
USDA also lists nontraditional livestock, including gamerelated&#13;
animals, exotic livestock and minor breeds, poultry,&#13;
and aquaculture.58 Government programs encourage&#13;
production of some of these crops and livestock.&#13;
3.1. Crops&#13;
Though the term ‘specialty crops’ is often used for all crops&#13;
that are ineligible for income support under federal Farm&#13;
Bill commodity programs59, a statutory definition refers to&#13;
‘fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, and&#13;
horticulture and nursery crops (including floriculture).’60&#13;
These specialty crops have become increasingly significant,&#13;
both for US consumption and for export. Fruits, vegetables,&#13;
and tree nuts make up almost a third of crop cash receipts&#13;
and, together with floriculture, greenhouse, and nursery&#13;
crops, almost 50 percent of crop cash receipts. Specialty&#13;
crops are grown on about 3 percent of harvested cropland,&#13;
and most growers are ‘specialized,’ with over half their value&#13;
of production from specialty crops.61&#13;
The Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 was&#13;
designed to increase consumption of fruits, vegetables and&#13;
nuts and to improve the competitiveness of specialty crop&#13;
producers.62 The law authorized block grants to states for&#13;
market research and promotion to enhance competitiveness&#13;
of specialty crops; state projects should benefit the industry&#13;
or the public. The law also financed technical assistance and&#13;
encouraged research. The 2008 Farm Bill (the first Farm&#13;
Bill to include a title devoted to specialty crops) increased&#13;
funding for grants to states to promote specialty crops. In&#13;
addition, the Farm Bill authorized funds for research on&#13;
specialty crops, programs for pest detection and control,&#13;
and measures to increase consumption of fresh fruits and&#13;
vegetables.63&#13;
Congress has authorized the promotion of some specialty&#13;
crops through free-standing ‘checkoff ’ programs. These&#13;
programs are proposed by industry groups, governed by&#13;
federal statutes and USDA regulations, and implemented&#13;
by majority vote of producers and handlers in the industry&#13;
association. Producers and handlers pay assessments, on the basis of sales revenue per unit of commodity, and an&#13;
industry board uses the funds primarily to promote the&#13;
commodity through generic advertising, but also to develop&#13;
new uses and support research.64 Checkoff programs are&#13;
available for some specialty crops, including potatoes,&#13;
flowers, honey, watermelon, pecans, mushrooms, limes,&#13;
kiwifruit, and avocado.65 Some states also have programs to&#13;
support specialty (and other) crops (eg, New Jersey Fresh&#13;
for fruits and vegetables).66&#13;
Producers who participate in the farm income and&#13;
commodity support program face a possible disincentive to&#13;
diversification with specialty crops. They are restricted from&#13;
growing and harvesting perennial fruits, vegetables (other&#13;
than mung beans and pulse crops), or wild rice on base&#13;
acres for which they receive benefits.67 The 2008 Farm Bill&#13;
retained this restriction from earlier legislation68, but&#13;
directed the Department of Agriculture to develop a pilot&#13;
project to permit planting of ‘cucumbers, green peas, lima&#13;
beans, pumpkins, snap beans, sweet corn, and tomatoes&#13;
grown for processing on base acres’ in crop years 2009&#13;
through 2012.69 The pilot project is authorized in only&#13;
seven states on a total of 75,000 acres (30,377 hectares).&#13;
Producers must agree to produce the crop under a contract&#13;
for processing and meet other regulatory requirements.&#13;
3.2. Livestock&#13;
Recent decades have seen the industrialization of US&#13;
livestock farming. Between 1987 and 2002, the ‘production&#13;
locus’ of livestock farming increased 60 percent for broilers,&#13;
100 percent for fed cattle, 240 percent for dairy, and 2,000&#13;
percent for hog production.70 This dramatic shift to larger&#13;
operations takes advantage of economies of scale and results&#13;
in increased productivity (and more risk to the&#13;
environment).71&#13;
Smaller farmers, as a result, may increase production, go&#13;
out of business, or consider production of exotic or&#13;
specialty livestock or animals for niche markets.72 These&#13;
include, for example, alpaca, bees, bison, goats, ostrich,&#13;
llama, caribou, elk, deer, or even worms. Information to&#13;
help producers is available from USDA73 and some state&#13;
sources.74 Industry organizations, too, provide advice for&#13;
production of exotic livestock.75&#13;
3.3. Aquaculture&#13;
Aquaculture is a growing area of farm diversification.&#13;
Aquaculture is the ‘propagation and rearing of aquatic&#13;
species [including aquatic plants] in controlled or selected&#13;
environments,’ either freshwater or saltwater, for all or part&#13;
of their lifecycle.76 The 2005 Census of Aquaculture&#13;
reported farm-level sales of almost $1.1 billion in&#13;
aquaculture products from over 4000 farms.77 Food fish&#13;
make up the majority of these products, but fish farmers&#13;
also raise sport fish, bait, ornamental fish, crustaceans, and&#13;
mollusks.78&#13;
The National Aquaculture Act of 198079 and the National&#13;
Aquaculture Development Plan80 have helped to encourage&#13;
aquaculture production. The Plan, in particular, was&#13;
intended to ‘include, where appropriate, programs to&#13;
analyze, and formulate proposed resolutions of, the legal or&#13;
regulatory constraints that may affect aquaculture.’81&#13;
During the 1980s and thereafter, state and federal programs&#13;
helped to encourage aquaculture. The Illinois Aquaculture Development Act, for example, encourages the practice of&#13;
aquaculture. It includes aquaculture in state definitions of&#13;
agriculture: ‘aquaculture shall be considered an agricultural&#13;
pursuit as provided in the [US] Internal Revenue Code ...&#13;
and for purposes of any laws that apply to or provide for&#13;
the advancement, benefit or protection of the agriculture&#13;
industry of the State.’82 This provision and similar laws in&#13;
other states help to ensure that aquaculture operations will&#13;
be considered agriculture and can therefore benefit from&#13;
legislation and programs that promote and protect&#13;
agricultural activities.&#13;
4. Marketing Strategies&#13;
Some farm diversification takes the form of marketing&#13;
strategies. Producers may, for example, sell products directly&#13;
to consumers at farmers’ markets, roadside stands, or&#13;
through community supported agriculture (subscription&#13;
farms). Others may add value to a crop by processing,&#13;
packing, or other activities. Two programs in the 2008&#13;
Farm Bill, the Farmers’ Market Promotion Program and the&#13;
Value-Added Producer Grants Program, help to ‘increase&#13;
farmers’ share of the food and agricultural system profit ...&#13;
and increase consumer access to healthy food.’83&#13;
4.1. Direct Marketing&#13;
Farmers’ markets and other direct marketing devices allow&#13;
farmers to receive retail prices for their farm products – that&#13;
is, farmers can be ‘price makers’ instead of ‘price takers.’&#13;
Between 1997 and 2007, direct food marketing to&#13;
consumers increased 104.7 percent, though total sales of&#13;
agricultural products increased only 47.6 percent.84&#13;
Between 1994 and 2006, the number of farmers’ markets&#13;
in the US increased by almost 150 percent, and in 2009,&#13;
USDA identified 5,274 markets.85 To some extent, federal&#13;
law has helped to stimulate this growth. The Farmers’&#13;
Market Promotion Program (FMPP), amended by the&#13;
2008 Farm Bill, encourages consumption of locally-grown&#13;
agricultural products by promoting producer-to-consumer&#13;
ventures, including farmers’ markets, roadside stands,&#13;
community supported agriculture, and agritourism.86&#13;
Competitive grants, with a maximum of $100,000, are&#13;
available for local governments, producer associations,&#13;
regional farmers’ market authorities, and other entities.&#13;
Grant funds may be used for purposes related to direct&#13;
marketing, and some funds must facilitate the use at&#13;
farmers’ markets of electronic benefits transfer cards from&#13;
federal nutrition programs (eg, food stamps).&#13;
Farmers’ markets and other direct marketing ventures are&#13;
subject to numerous laws and regulations. Federal, state,&#13;
and local laws may apply; therefore legal issues raised by&#13;
direct marketing vary by location. For example, local land&#13;
use requirements may apply; state or local licenses may be&#13;
required; food hygiene rules may require that food sold at a&#13;
market be prepared in a kitchen that meets regulatory&#13;
standards; and state sales tax laws may apply. Some states&#13;
and municipalities have special exemptions for direct&#13;
marketing; others do not. In addition, each farmers’ market&#13;
will have its own regulations that govern issues such as&#13;
application or site fees, permits or licenses, health&#13;
inspections, products that may be sold, market operation,&#13;
and other provisions. Markets often require vendors to&#13;
comply with applicable state and local rules and&#13;
regulations.87&#13;
Other forms of direct marketing are common. For example,&#13;
community supported agriculture involves direct sales.&#13;
Through a legal or other commitment, members of the&#13;
farm provide the farmer’s salary and costs of the farm&#13;
operation in exchange for shares of the farm produce.&#13;
Producers provide weekly deliveries of in-season farm&#13;
products to members, who share some risks of&#13;
production.88 Roadside stands or pick-your-own operations&#13;
involve direct sale of in-season produce to consumers, often&#13;
on the farm property. Some producers sell farm products&#13;
(including value-added products, like cheese) directly to a&#13;
restaurants or shops.&#13;
4.2. Value-Added Products&#13;
Value-added agriculture is another area of diversification in&#13;
which a farmer adds value to a traditional crop by&#13;
processing it or converting it into unique products. A valueadded&#13;
enterprise can help to increase farm income and give&#13;
consumers a wider choice of foods and other farm&#13;
products.89 Value-added enterprises often involve the&#13;
processing of raw farm products into other food items - eg,&#13;
converting corn into corn meal, processing fruits into jam,&#13;
or making cheese from goat milk.&#13;
The sale of processed or prepared foods may trigger&#13;
application of federal or state laws that regulate food&#13;
processing, food labeling, food handling, and other matters.&#13;
The producer may need state licenses and be subject to&#13;
inspections and enforcement. In addition, the sale of meat&#13;
and poultry products may trigger application of federal and&#13;
state meat inspection laws.90&#13;
Federal law encourages value-added enterprises. Valueadded&#13;
producer grants, authorized in 2000 and expanded&#13;
in the 2002 and 2008 Farm Bills, make planning and&#13;
working capital available to agricultural producers and&#13;
specified producer groups to develop enterprises that&#13;
produce value-added products. For purposes of the grant&#13;
program, a ‘value-added agricultural product’ is any&#13;
agricultural commodity or product that has undergone a&#13;
‘change in physical state’ (eg, diced tomatoes or wool rugs),&#13;
is produced or segregated in a way that enhances its value&#13;
(eg, organic crops), is a source of renewable energy, or is&#13;
marketed as locally-produced food. In addition, the&#13;
physical change or manner of production must expand the&#13;
customer base, and the producer must receive a greater&#13;
portion of revenue from marketing, processing, or physical&#13;
segregation of the product.91&#13;
In the competitive grant process, priority goes to projects&#13;
that increase opportunities for beginning farmers or&#13;
ranchers, socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers, and&#13;
operators of small and medium sized family farms. The&#13;
recipient must match the amount of the grant with nonfederal&#13;
funds or in-kind contributions. The maximum&#13;
grant for fiscal 2009 is $300,000, with a simplified&#13;
application for small (less than $50,000) projects.92 Grants&#13;
have been awarded to projects such as development of a&#13;
frozen-dough bakery in Oklahoma and production and&#13;
marketing of single-serving fruit bowls in California.93&#13;
5. Agritourism and Recreational Uses&#13;
Agritourism links agricultural production with&#13;
opportunities for recreation, education, or entertainment&#13;
available to members of the public. It supplements and&#13;
diversifies farm income and expands employment for&#13;
members of the farm household. Moreover, it often benefits&#13;
the local community by generating economic activity (with&#13;
related tax revenue) and protecting farmland and natural&#13;
amenities.94 Though not as developed in the US as in&#13;
Europe95, agritourism was expected to generate $560&#13;
million in 2008. In 2007, about 1.9 percent of US farms&#13;
(39,500 farms, the majority in the South and Midwest)&#13;
provided recreational activities. Small operations (sales&#13;
under $50,000) were 60 percent of farms with income from&#13;
recreation, but their earnings were only 40 percent of total&#13;
recreation earnings. Most income came from outdoor&#13;
recreation (including hunting, fishing, and horseback&#13;
riding) and hospitality (bed and breakfast, ranch stays).96&#13;
Although some federal statutes are relevant97, in general,&#13;
state common law and statutes apply to agritourism and&#13;
agricultural recreational uses. Some activities (eg,&#13;
hospitality) may require state or local licenses or permits.&#13;
An important concern for agritourism enterprises is&#13;
liability, especially for injuries to participants.&#13;
Most states have enacted statutes that limit liability of&#13;
landowners for injuries that occur during recreational use of&#13;
agricultural land. Under these recreational use statutes, a&#13;
landowner owes no duty of care to keep property safe for&#13;
entry or use for recreational activities so long as the&#13;
landowner does not maliciously or willfully conceal&#13;
hazardous conditions. That protection, however, does not&#13;
usually apply if the landowner receives payment for the&#13;
recreational use.98&#13;
Similarly, laws in over twenty states promote or facilitate&#13;
agritourism.99 Though many provide governmental or&#13;
financial support, a few mitigate liability. One law, for&#13;
example, allows agritourism operators to register their&#13;
agritourism activity with the state. Participants then assume&#13;
the inherent risks of the registered agritourism activity; the&#13;
agritourism location must post notice about assumption of&#13;
the risk and include notice in written contracts.100&#13;
In most states, however, the farmer or rancher who operates&#13;
an agritourism business will owe a high duty of care to&#13;
participants and must ensure that hazards on the farm property do not threaten their safety. Liability insurance&#13;
tailored to the operation is essential.101&#13;
6. Conservation&#13;
Numerous federal programs encourage farmers and&#13;
ranchers to adopt conservation practices.102 Conservation&#13;
payments under federal farm programs have increased in&#13;
amount103, and the 2008 Farm Bill enacted new programs&#13;
and authorized increased conservation spending, especially&#13;
for conservation practices on working lands. The&#13;
Conservation Stewardship Program104 and the&#13;
Environmental Quality Incentives Program105 are important&#13;
examples. Conservation programs for working land often&#13;
help producers adopt environmentally sound practices in&#13;
their ongoing operation. This article does not emphasize&#13;
programs for working land, which often apply to traditional&#13;
agricultural activities.&#13;
Land retirement programs, in contrast, offer owners or&#13;
operators of eligible land the opportunity to diversify by&#13;
setting aside vulnerable land for conservation purposes.106&#13;
The following discussion focuses briefly on two major&#13;
programs, the Conservation Reserve and the Wetlands&#13;
Reserve. Others, eg, the Grasslands Reserve107, offer&#13;
opportunities for payments in exchange for restrictions on&#13;
land use.&#13;
6.1. Conservation Reserve Program&#13;
The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)108, established in&#13;
1985 and most recently amended in the 2008 Farm Bill, is&#13;
a voluntary program that offers environmental benefits,&#13;
including reduced erosion and water pollution. Eligible&#13;
land includes highly erodible cropland, marginal&#13;
pastureland, and certain other vulnerable land. During&#13;
sign-up periods, applicants with eligible land compete for&#13;
CRP contracts, with preference to land with highest&#13;
environmental benefits. A smaller continuous sign-up&#13;
program targets specific environmental objectives (eg,&#13;
riparian buffers, filter strips, grass waterways, farmable&#13;
wetlands).&#13;
Under the CRP, agricultural owners, operators, or tenants109&#13;
enter 10 or 15-year contracts with the federal government.&#13;
In exchange for annual per-acre rental payments,&#13;
participants agree to retire land from agricultural use, to&#13;
implement an approved conservation plan, and to plant&#13;
approved vegetative cover on the CRP land. The federal&#13;
government shares the cost of establishing conservation&#13;
practices required by contract. Producers may obtain&#13;
permission to use CRP land for some commercial uses.&#13;
These include commercial shooting preserves; managed&#13;
haying, including harvest of biomass, and limited grazing&#13;
(with a reduction of annual payments); forestry&#13;
maintenance; sale of carbon, water quality and other&#13;
environmental credits; and installation of wind turbines.110&#13;
The 2008 Farm Bill reauthorized the CRP through 2012,&#13;
but reduced maximum enrollment from 39.2 million to 32&#13;
million acres (15.88 to 12.96 million hectares). In October&#13;
2009, 31.12 million acres (12.6 million hectares) –&#13;
727,000 contracts on 409,000 farms – were enrolled in all&#13;
CRP programs; total annual rental payments were&#13;
estimated at $1.64 billion. Average rental payments on&#13;
most CRP land were $44.64 per acre.111 Thus the CRP&#13;
offers a type of diversification, albeit with significant land&#13;
use restrictions, for owners or operators of eligible land.&#13;
6.2. Wetlands Reserve Program&#13;
The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP)112, established in&#13;
1990, allows owners of eligible land to receive payments for&#13;
long-term protection of eligible wetlands. The 2008 Farm&#13;
Bill reauthorized the WRP through 2012, with an increased&#13;
maximum of 3.04 million acres (1.23 million hectares) and&#13;
a decreased annual enrollment goal of 185,000 acres&#13;
(74,900 hectares). Land eligible for the WRP is farmed or&#13;
converted wetland (with functionally dependent adjacent&#13;
land) and land used for production prior to certain&#13;
flooding. Under a competitive enrollment process, priority&#13;
goes to wetlands that maximize wildlife values and provide cost-effective conservation benefits. Acreage can be enrolled&#13;
under permanent easements, 30-year easements, restoration&#13;
cost-share agreements, or a combination of these options.&#13;
Owners of WRP land must grant an easement to the&#13;
United States, implement a conservation plan, and record a&#13;
deed restriction under state law. In exchange, they receive&#13;
compensation (a lump sum or annual installments) for the&#13;
easement plus cost-share payments for conservation&#13;
measures and technical assistance. The landowner retains&#13;
title to the land and, by agreement, can use the land for&#13;
compatible economic uses (eg, hunting, fishing, managed&#13;
timber).&#13;
7. Renewable Energy&#13;
In light of climate change and other environmental&#13;
concerns, renewable energy – eg, wind energy or biofuels –&#13;
is increasingly significant. Several types of activities&#13;
connected with renewable energy offer opportunities for&#13;
farm diversification or additional income.&#13;
7.1. Biomass Energy&#13;
Biofuels are ‘transportation fuels produced from plants and&#13;
other organic materials.’113 US policy supports biofuels&#13;
through tax credits for production or sale of ethanol and&#13;
biodiesel, as well as imposition of a renewable fuel&#13;
standard.114 Indeed, at least two dozen programs,&#13;
administered by five federal agencies, govern biofuels, and&#13;
many offer incentives or assistance for producers and&#13;
others.115 The 2008 Farm Bill established or amended&#13;
biofuel incentives and tax credits and authorized other&#13;
programs to encourage renewable energy.116&#13;
One new program, for example, provides incentives for&#13;
farmers whose plans for diversification include crops for&#13;
biomass energy. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program&#13;
assists producers who will supply biomass to a biomass&#13;
conversion facility.117 The program will support production&#13;
of eligible crops for conversion to bioenergy and help&#13;
owners and operators of agricultural and forest land to&#13;
collect, harvest, store, and transport biomass material. In a&#13;
competitive application process, a project sponsor (eg, a&#13;
biomass conversion facility or a group of producers) will&#13;
apply for designation as a project area. Farmers in a project&#13;
area will contract with USDA (five years for annual or&#13;
perennial crops; 15 years for woody biomass). They will&#13;
receive annual incentive or cost-share payments and a perton&#13;
payment (matched by the biomass conversion facility)&#13;
for costs of collection, harvest, storage, and transportation.&#13;
Crops eligible for farm program commodity payments (eg,&#13;
corn, wheat, oilseeds, etc) are not eligible for the biomass&#13;
program.&#13;
7.2. Wind Energy&#13;
Wind energy is a fast-growing industry.118 In locations with&#13;
access to unobstructed wind of sufficient velocity, wind&#13;
energy projects offer landowners the opportunity to&#13;
diversify. Developers of wind energy projects must have&#13;
access to land, both for turbines and associated uses and for&#13;
buffer zones. Because turbines and other equipment occupy&#13;
a relatively small footprint, farming and ranching are&#13;
compatible with wind energy. Location of wind turbines on&#13;
farmland can provide supplementary income through lease&#13;
payments and royalties.119&#13;
An increasing number of state and local jurisdictions have&#13;
enacted laws and regulations to govern the location and&#13;
operation of wind energy projects120, and builders of&#13;
projects must comply with these requirements. Farmers&#13;
whose land will be part of a large project generally lease&#13;
land to the project developer. The lease will bind the farmer&#13;
for a long term, and many issues (eg, lease term,&#13;
compensation, access rights, termination and removal of&#13;
equipment) must be resolved. Legal advice is therefore&#13;
critical.&#13;
8. Conclusion&#13;
As the discussion above has indicated, producers in the US&#13;
have many choices for diversification that can help to&#13;
achieve financial and personal goals. Producers can plant&#13;
nontraditional crops, grow specialty breeds or livestock, or&#13;
adopt organic methods of production. They can market&#13;
their produce directly to consumers or process farm&#13;
products to add value. They can earn farm-related income&#13;
by opening their land for agritourism or wind energy, and&#13;
they can collect rental payments by setting aside vulnerable&#13;
farmland for conservation. Other opportunities also exist.&#13;
The federal government and some state governments&#13;
provide financial and other incentives for agricultural&#13;
diversification. Some new activities raise few legal questions&#13;
or obstacles, but others trigger additional legal&#13;
requirements, foreclose benefits provided to traditional&#13;
agriculture, require licenses or permits, or increase the&#13;
farmer’s risk of liability. The producer who plans to&#13;
diversify the farming operation will need a careful business&#13;
plan and competent legal advice.&#13;
The rewards of diversification can be great, both for&#13;
producers and their families and for the rural community.&#13;
As one federally-funded organization noted, ‘[t]oday’s …&#13;
farmers, with their prices global and their costs local, are&#13;
ensnared in an ever-tightening profit squeeze. ...&#13;
Diversifying can soften impacts on environmental&#13;
resources, spread farmers’ economic risk, exploit profitable&#13;
niche markets and – by creating new industries based on&#13;
renewable agriculture resources – strengthen rural&#13;
communities.’121 Indeed, in the US, diversification&#13;
promises to be increasingly important in managing&#13;
financial risk and enhancing the financial status of farm&#13;
households. In addition, diversification can enrich the&#13;
communities in which farmers live and work and promote&#13;
a sustainable agricultural heritage.</content><legacyfootnotes>* Professor and Bock Chair in Agricultural Law, University of Illinois,&#13;

average of $3,167 per farm; the largest farms (sales over $1 million)&#13;
made up only 3 percent of those farms and received 22 percent of&#13;
total payments, an average of $80,386 per farm. Smaller farms&#13;
received only 5 percent of commodity payments, but 55 percent of&#13;
conservation payments; farms with more than $500,000 in sales (7&#13;
percent of farms receiving government payments) collected almost 50&#13;
percent of commodity payments. J. Michael Harris et al., Agricultural&#13;
