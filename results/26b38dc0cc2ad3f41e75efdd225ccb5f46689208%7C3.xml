Since the earliest days of settlement in what is now the United States, agriculture&#13;
has dominated the social and economie structure. Early settlers, blessed with fertile&#13;
land and sufficient water, established their farms and plantations and helped to&#13;
shape the agrarian attitudes of the emerging nation.1 The development of familyowned&#13;
farms along the frontiers of the New World coincided with the belief that&#13;
the family farm, owned by those who tilled the soil, was central to a democratie&#13;
society.2&#13;
Although existing from the founding days of the nation, this concept has often&#13;
been articulated as part of the Jeffersonian ideal. As Thomas Jefferson wrote, 'Cultivators&#13;
of the earth are the most valuable citizens. They are the most vigorous, the&#13;
most independent, the most virtuous, and they are tied to their country, and wedded&#13;
to its liberty and interests, by the most lasting bonds.'3 Encouragement of the class&#13;
of land-owning farmers required widespread distribution of land in small parcels.4&#13;
And indeed, during the period of settlement of the nation, land was sold cheaply&#13;
or given f ree to certain aspiring farmers. In this young agrarian nation the farmer&#13;
was idealized for his simple, honest, healthy and wholesome life style.&#13;
As the nation developed, the nature of agriculture changed. Free (or nearly f ree)&#13;
land became less available and in some areas water was not adequate. Drawn by the&#13;
promise of employment, large numbers of people moved to the cities. Near the beginning&#13;
of the twentieth century agriculture itself was influenced by the industrial&#13;
revolution. In a sense, these changes in the agriculture industry can be said to have&#13;
led to the development of modern agricultural law. For example, the large amounts&#13;
of capital necessitated by industrialization and the unavailability of free land resulted&#13;
in early federal laws providing credit especially for farmers.5&#13;
In ensuing years, American agriculture became ever more closely entangled with the legal system. In many instances, farmers received preferred treatment under the&#13;
law. Federal farm programs giving price and income support to farmers were enacted,&#13;
and farmers were often exempted from obligations under general social legislation&#13;
(for example, laws regulating hired labor).6 The development of agricultural&#13;
law was influenced by the continued perception that agriculture was unique and required&#13;
special policies and protection.&#13;
Today, in the 1980s, agriculture is no longer the prime dominating force in American&#13;
society. But agriculture continues to be one of the most significant business enterprises,&#13;
and its importance is multiplied by the related industries that provide&#13;
equipment and inputs and that process and market farm products. Moreover, the&#13;
structure of agriculture continues to be unique. For example, the majority of farms&#13;
are still family owned and operated, rather unusual in an economy characterized by&#13;
broad public ownership of business firms. The farm family workers also bear the&#13;
risk of production, which depends on variables (for example, temperature and rainfall)&#13;
that are less significant in other industries.7 Thus, though the agrarian ideal&#13;
has been tempered and the farming industry has lost some of its special character,&#13;
the favored status of agriculture is still reflected to some extent in the body of law&#13;
that is called 'agricultural law.' More importantly, that favored status had enhanced&#13;
the development of the specialized study and practice of agricultural law.</inleiding><content>A DIGRESSION: THE FEDERAL SYSTEM&#13;
To elucidate the position of agricultural law in the United States, it is necessary to&#13;
focus briefly on the federal system of government, which developed in the context&#13;
of the young agrarian nation. Law governing agriculture sterns from many sources,&#13;
and the interrelationship of these sources, particularly federal and state law affect -&#13;
ing agriculture, reflects in part the constitutional allocation of powers to the federal&#13;
and state governments.&#13;
Under the United States Constitution, Congress is vested with certain enumerated&#13;
powers.8 Among these is the power derived from the Commerce Clause,9 which authorizes&#13;
a wide spectrum of federal regulation, including much of the federal law&#13;
that concerns agriculture. In addition, Congress has the authority to enact all laws&#13;
necessary and proper for carrying out its constitutional powers.10&#13;
The Constitution also ensures that the individual states retain some measure of&#13;
sovereignty. The Tenth Amendment provides that powers not delegated to the federal&#13;
government or otherwise prohibited to the states are reserved to the states or to the people.11 One important power that resides in state government is the socalled&#13;
'police power.' This gives state governments the authority to legislate to protect&#13;
the public health, safety, and welfare. Used for a variety of state regulatory&#13;
schemes, the police power is the basis for many state laws that regulate agriculture.&#13;
Moreover, some aspects of state power are often delegated to county and municipal&#13;
governments.&#13;
By granting specific powers to the federal government and reserving others to the&#13;
states, the Constitution restricts the regulatory authority of the federal government.&#13;
Since the early years of the nation, the nature of this relationship between federal&#13;
and state powers has been subject to debate. Even in the present decade, issues involving&#13;
the question of 'federalism' have continued to provoke conflict between the&#13;
federal and state governments. Despite the developing nature of federalism, it can&#13;
be said that the direct coercion the federal government can exert over states is limited;&#13;
for example, states cannot normally be forced to legislate or regulate. But states&#13;
can cooperate voluntarily with the federal government, and that cooperation can be&#13;
induced indirectly through incentives.12&#13;
One concept integral to an understanding of this federal-state relationship is the&#13;
doctrine of preemption, which delineates the extent of federal power to exclude state&#13;
governments from an area of legislation and the constitutional inability of states to&#13;
enter some areas of legislation.13 Based on the Supremacy Clause,14 the doctrine&#13;
establishes that a state law is void if it conflicts with the US Constitution or if it&#13;
is inconsistent with federal statutes enacted by Congress under a specific power enumerated&#13;
in the Constitution. Preemption can be imposed either by specific provision&#13;
in a statute or by judicial decision. In determining whether Congress has exercised&#13;
its preemptive powers, the first inquiry is whether Congress has the constitutional&#13;
authority to preempt state law that is, whether it acted within its enumerated&#13;
powers. The second inquiry is whether Congress intended to preempt state law.&#13;
Preemption is relevant when Congress occupies a field of regulation or when state&#13;
law actually conflicts with a federal enactment. Congress may indicate expressly in&#13;
a statute or in legislative history that it intended to occupy a field of regulation. Alternatively,&#13;
its intention may be inferred from the regulatory scheme.15 That is,&#13;
conflict between state and federal laws may occur if it is impossible to comply with&#13;
both laws, or when state law obstructs fulfillment of federal objectives.16 In deciding&#13;
preemption cases, the United States Supreme Court has indicated reluctance to overturn state laws, unless a congressional intent to preempt is clear.17&#13;
"Preemption need not always be total.18 For example, in the area of law invol-ving&#13;
regulation of pollution from agriculture, the federal state relationship can often be&#13;
characterized as partial preemption, an approach that centralizes policy formula-tion,&#13;
but shares implementation with state government. Under this partial preemption&#13;
approach, the federal government exercises its authority to set regulatory policy; state&#13;
governments are then encouraged to adopt, administer, and enforce na-tional policy&#13;
standards.19 This approach preserves some state control and allows states to design&#13;
programs for individual pollution problems.20 WHAT IS AGRICULTURAL LAW?&#13;
In light of this background, it may be useful to define the parameters of agricultural&#13;
law, as that subject is viewed in the United States. One approach to agricultural law&#13;
might focus on law that is unique to agriculture. Even this narrow approach would&#13;
involve a substantial body of law. It is more practical and accurate, however, to&#13;
adopt a broader viewpoint and to include in the field all law that governs or otherwise&#13;
affects agricultural operations and activities.21&#13;
From a pedagogical point of view, one might take a slightly different approach.&#13;
As the authors of a new agricultural law textbook have noted, agricultural law is a&#13;
'complex and highly integrated field of law,' unified by several broad themes.22 First,&#13;
the critical role of land for agriculture has resulted in specialized legal rules.23 Second,&#13;
agriculture is the nation's most highly regulated industry, but with economie&#13;
regulation intended to protect farmers from the effects of competition. Third,&#13;
regulatory efforts are often directed toward the structure of agriculture, particularly&#13;
protection of the family-sized farm. Thus, agricultural law can be defined as 'the&#13;
study of the laws and institutions that have developed to reflect unique characteristics&#13;
of agriculture, including the importance of land as a productive input, recognition that the agricultural output is of such social and political importance&#13;
that normal roles of government in fostering competition are reversed in favor of&#13;
policies that facilitate collusion and collective action, and the historie social preference&#13;
in favor of relatively small scale family farm.'24&#13;
As the brief digression on the federal-state relationship suggests, the sources of&#13;
this complex body of agricultural law are varied. Agriculture is governed by the&#13;
overarching principles enunciated in federal and state constitutions. It is governed&#13;
by common law principles and judicial decisions. And it is regulated by federal statutes&#13;
and administrative regulations, state statutes and rules, and sometimes by local&#13;
law (county or municipal ordinances) as well. In addition, many aspects of agriculture&#13;
are also governed by what might be called private law: the contractual agreements&#13;
that are made by individuals and organizations and that can be enforced&#13;
through the legal system.&#13;
In some areas of law, agriculture is governed by the same legislation or legal principles&#13;
- for example, contract, tort, or nuisance law - that affect other activities,&#13;
though occasionally those principles are modified to protect agricultural operations.&#13;
25 Sometimes, however, agricultural operations are exempted in whole or in&#13;
part from laws governing other activities. Further, a large number of federal and&#13;
state statutes focus solely on agriculture.&#13;
Agricultural law is a broad field, one which requires acquaintance with general&#13;
legal principles as well as the agricultural application of those principles and of specialized&#13;
statutes. Among the subjects the field may include are contract, tort, employment,&#13;
property, landlord-tenant, environmental law, water, minerals, cooperatives,&#13;
estate planning, income taxation, gift and estate taxation, administrative law,&#13;
business planning and organization, debtor-creditor relations, and (unfortunately)&#13;
bankruptcy.&#13;
The many areas of regulation involving agriculture and the federalism characteristic&#13;
of the United States suggest some allocation of powers between federal and&#13;
state governments in the area of agricultural law. While it is true that both federal&#13;
and state (and sometimes local) laws govern agriculture, it is difficult to generalize&#13;
about the areas in which federal or state regulation predominates. Under a broad&#13;
interpretation of interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution,&#13;
the federal government could regulate most aspects of agriculture. Actually,&#13;
the federal government regulates broadly, but exercises complete preemption relatively&#13;
rarely, thus leaving the states free to regulate, concurrently or independently.&#13;
An example focusing on an individual farmer may help to suggest both the complexity&#13;
of the legal status of agriculture in the United States and how an agricultural&#13;
operation reflects this complexity.26&#13;
The base for the farmer's operation is the land, and law affecting real property&#13;
is predominantly state law. Thus, the farmer's land purchase, real estate mortgage, and his lease will be designed in accordance with the real estate and leasing law of&#13;
the state where the land is located. The farmer may be influenced to protect the land&#13;
for farming by state, local, or (more rarely) federal programs to encourage conservation.&#13;
The environmental hazards of the operation will be subject to federal and&#13;
state pollution laws. The farmer's decision about erop production will sometimes&#13;
turn on the availability of federal farm programs to provide loans and price or income&#13;
support.&#13;
The farmer's relationship with employees involves a large number of federal and&#13;
state laws.27 Workers' compensation for on-the-job injury, for example, is normal-ly&#13;
state law; safety in the workplace is regulated by federal law, though states also&#13;
regulate in this area.&#13;
In marketing his products (and in numerous other decisions), the farmer will be&#13;
influenced by federal income tax law. The elevator (grain warehouse) to which the&#13;
farmer hauls his grain may choose whether to be federally or state licensed. State&#13;
law normally establishes the farmer's rights in grain stored in the warehouse. But&#13;
the farmer who sells livestock will be protected under federal law. Moreover, the&#13;
commodity futures market that the farmer may use to protect his position is federally&#13;
regulated.&#13;
The current severe financial distress experienced by many farmers and farm lenders&#13;
complicates the picture. Normally, the farmer's relationship with creditors will&#13;
be based primarily on state law. Thus, foreclosures on mortgages proceed under&#13;
state law, and creditors with personal property (for example, farm products) as collateral&#13;
for their loans have remedies under the state Uniform Commercial Code.28 If&#13;
the farmer's creditor is the federal government (or the federally-regulated farm&#13;
credit system), however, federal law will govern the debtor-creditor relationship.&#13;
But if the farmer decides to declare bankruptcy, these state law relationships and&#13;
creditor remedies are altered by federal bankruptcy law.&#13;
This brief sketch is complicated, on a national level, by the fact that state law real-ly&#13;
involves the law of fifty different states. While that law is often similar from state to&#13;
state, significant variations can and do occur.&#13;
DEVELOPMENT OF THE DISCIPLINE&#13;
Agricultural law as a specialized discipline is a relatively recent development. As&#13;
might be expected, the applieability of law to agriculture has long been acknowledged.&#13;
29 Indeed, for at least 50 years 'law and agriculture' - that is, what farmers&#13;
and their attorneys needed to know about the law — has been recognized. Nonetheless,&#13;
farmers did not (and still do not) always have easy access to legal advice, in&#13;
part because they often lived in phycisal isolation. Moreover, relatively few attorneys have had the specialized knowledge needed to advise farmers effectively.&#13;
The 1970s, however, witnessed a renewed interest in agricultural law. Several factors&#13;
help to explain this renewal. The agricultural sector had come to enjoy less political&#13;
force; thus, it increased its use of other legal means (for example, the courts)&#13;
to express its positions. Yet the sector continued to be a significant economie force;&#13;
agricultural trade policies were an important factor in the balance of payments and&#13;
in foreign relations. Moreover, the concentration of agricultural production and&#13;
marketing in large operations exerted pressure on the existing legal arrangements.&#13;
Finally, farmers began to recognize law as a tooi to be used actively in developing&#13;
and modifying their operations. These factors led to an increased demand for legal&#13;
information connected with agriculture.30&#13;
One result of this renewed interest in agricultural law in the United States has been&#13;
an increasing respect for the discipline. Agricultural law has been recognized as appropriate&#13;
subject matter for a law school course, an area of specialization for practicing&#13;
attorneys, a topic for continuing legal education (post-graduate training for&#13;
attorneys), and a field for scholarly research and publication.31 Agricultural law&#13;
now reaches beyond the practical knowledge of the law related to farming operations.&#13;
It constitutes a separate and distinct area of law to 'encourage and facilitate&#13;
the concentration and synthesis of those parts of law relating to agriculture.'32 It&#13;
has developed as a scholarly discipline, which is also helping to raise the level of skill&#13;
of practitioners.&#13;
ACADEMIC&#13;
Some elucidation of the history of agricultural law as an academie discipline in the&#13;
United States is helpful.33 Early in the twentieth century, a Farmers' Manual of&#13;
Law, focusing primarily on contract and real estate law, was published by a law professor.&#13;
34 But real academie focus on agricultural law began only much later. In the&#13;
universities, the subject has evolved from two separate directions: in Colleges of&#13;
Agriculture35 and in Colleges of Law.&#13;
Agricultural law developed first in Colleges of Agriculture. Indeed, the College&#13;
of Agriculture model evolved at my own institution, the University of Illinois. As&#13;
early as 1867, a course focusing on agricultural land was recommended. The agricultural&#13;
law program actually began, however, only in 1939, when Professor H.W.&#13;
Hannah began to teach agricultural law in the Department of Agricultural Economics.36 The program has thrived. The three professors make up the largest agricultural&#13;
law group associated with a College of Agriculture in the United States. They&#13;
participate in research and in teaching, both in university classes and in adult education&#13;
programs. But the nature of the University of Illinois agricultural law program&#13;
has evolved over the years since 1939. From an initial focus on land, undergraduate&#13;
teaching has been broadened to include a wide range of agricultural law subjects.&#13;
Adult education has expanded to include continuing legal education for lawyers and&#13;
other professionals, as well as for farmers. Also the nature of research and writing&#13;
has evolved from the first focus (which still continues) on practical legal problems&#13;
of farmers to intensive research on legal problems that interest scholars and practicing&#13;
attorneys. Among the areas of research are issues connected with taxation,&#13;
bankruptcy, farm business organizations, land use, tenancy, pollution, and water&#13;
law.&#13;
Agricultural law plays an important role at other Colleges of Agriculture as well.&#13;
More than twenty Colleges have agricultural law positions, often in departments of&#13;
agricultural economics. Most, but not all, of the incumbents are attorneys. Other&#13;
Colleges have individuals who sometimes explore agricultural law issues as part of&#13;
their other responsibilities.&#13;
The curriculum at a number of law schools also includes agricultural law. (It must&#13;
be noted that in the United States, students who attend law school have already&#13;
completed a bachelor's degree in a field of their choice.) At least ten, and probably&#13;
more, Colleges of Law have a course (or courses) in agricultural law taught by a&#13;
scholar who also conducts agricultural law research. The 1985 publication of an excellent&#13;
law school text37 has provided an important resource for professors and students,&#13;
and may make it easier for other law schools to offer a course. In Colleges&#13;
of Law, as in Colleges of Agriculture, classes in agricultural law are elective. Students&#13;
may choose to take the class, but are not normally required to enroll.&#13;
One interesting recent development is a Graduate Program in Agricultural Law&#13;
at the University of Arkansas School of Law. Students, who are already lawyers&#13;
with a J.D. degree, may earn a master's degree (Ll.M.) in agricultural law. The program&#13;
includes specialized classes (for example, taxation, federal regulation of agriculture,&#13;
cooperatives, agricultural land). Graduates of the program are finding excellent&#13;
positions in government and law practice.&#13;
PUBLICATIONS&#13;
Along with the development of agricultural law as an academie discipline has come&#13;
an expansion in the scholarly literature. United States legal scholars often publish&#13;
the results of their research in law reviews. Most law schools sponsor a law review,&#13;
usually a quarterly journal, edited by the most capable senior law students. During the first decades of this century, articles on agricultural law appeared intermittently&#13;
in law reviews.38 But during the 1960s and especially the 1970s, the number of individual&#13;
articles increased dramatically. In addition, whole law review issues were devoted&#13;
to symposia consisting of articles on agricultural law topics.39 This trend has&#13;
continued into the 1980s, with articles and symposia continuing to appear.40 Articles&#13;
cover the entire breadth of agricultural law, with subject matter directed toward&#13;
both scholars and practitioners.&#13;
In addition, a specialized national journal now exists. The Agricultural Law Journal&#13;
was published commercially for four years.41 This periodical was succeeded by&#13;
the Journal of Agricultural Taxation and Law,42 which began in 1983 and continues&#13;
to publïsh articles, by both academies and practitioners, intended primarily to&#13;
provide timely, authoritative information for practitioners.&#13;
Scholarly treatises are also beginning to appear. Most impressive and quite useful&#13;
is Professor Neil Harl's 15-volume treatise,43 which covers numerous aspects of&#13;
agricultural law in minute detail and which is updated regularly. Other shorter treatises&#13;
also exist.44 And, of course, books treating narrow areas of agricultural law&#13;
continue to be published.45&#13;
PRACTICE&#13;
The practice of agricultural law is increasingly complex. No longer is the agricultural&#13;
attorney just a 'country lawyer' whose clients are principally farmers. Now the agricultural&#13;
lawyer finds a role in major metropolitan law firms, as well as in small-town&#13;
law practices. He or she plays a crucial role in farm credit and agribusiness. State&#13;
and federal governments also provide positions for agricultural lawyers, as drafters&#13;
and enforcers of the many laws and regulations that affect agriculture. The United&#13;
States Department of Agriculture, for example, employs approximately 235 attorneys,&#13;
who help to administer the many federal statutes that affect the production,&#13;
marketing, and distribution of agricultural commodities.46&#13;
The development of agricultural law as a scholarly discipline has helped to facilitate&#13;
the practice of agricultural law through both publication of specialized in&#13;
formation and provision of continuing legal education for practicing attorneys. The&#13;
organized bar is also active. The American Bar Association has an agricultural law&#13;
committee,47 which sponsors educational programs for members of the bar. Some state bar associations, too, have committees to pro vide specialized information&#13;
to members. In Illinois, for example, the state agricultural law committee publishes&#13;
a newsletter and co-sponsors educational programs that are broadcast on sophisticated&#13;
telephone equipment to almost 100 locations throughout the state.&#13;
THE AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL LA W ASSOCIA TION&#13;
One reflection of the growing importance of agricultural law in the United States is&#13;
the development of a professional organization, the American Agricultural Law&#13;
Association (AALA).48 As scholarship and practice in agricultural law grew in significance&#13;
and complexity, lawyers needed a formal means of communication. In&#13;
1979, a private non-profit organization sponsored a conference in Chicago. Those&#13;
attending appointed a committee to recommend a proposed structure for an agricultural&#13;
law organization. In the ensuing year, the committee developed a corporate&#13;
structure and drafted articles of incorporation.&#13;
In December 1980, another conference was held at the University of Minnesota.&#13;
The 65 people attending voted to create the American Agricultural Law Association.&#13;
They elected officers and a Board of Directors. The organization was established&#13;
formally when it received its corporate charter from the state of Iowa.&#13;
From its small beginnings, the AALA has grown to an active organization of&#13;
nearly 800 members. Membership is open to any individual or institution professionally&#13;
interested in agricultural law. Practicing attorneys, law professors, government&#13;
officials, accountants, and professional farm managers make up most of the&#13;
membership. Students may also join. Leadership of AALA comes from professors&#13;
and practicing attorneys.&#13;
In the few years of its existence, the AALA has developed several important projects.&#13;
Each year, usually in the Fall, the AALA sponsors a Meeting and Educational&#13;
Conference. Most of the two-day conference is spent hearing and discussing papers on&#13;
agricultural law topics. Members find this interaction with other professionals quite&#13;
stimulating, and they often leave with new ideas for research and practice.&#13;
Proceedings of the conference are published, usually as an issue of a university law&#13;
review, and are provided to members who request the issue.&#13;
Another important service to AALA members is publication of a monthly&#13;
newsletter, Agricultural Law Update. This newsletter contains one 'in depth' article&#13;
and numerous short reports contributed by AALA members. It helps alert readers to&#13;
new judicial, legislative, and administrative developments. The organization also&#13;
publishes a membership directory, sponsors several telephone conferences among&#13;
members with common interests, and recently sponsored an examination exchange for&#13;
professors. AALA confers a Distinguished Service Award for outstanding contributions&#13;
to the profession and sponsors an essay contest for students. Now the Association hopes to develop working relationships with agricultural law organizations&#13;
in other nations.&#13;
CONCLUSION&#13;
As these remarks have suggested, agricultural law in the United States has reached&#13;
an exciting threshold. Though the specialized study of agricultural law is a recent&#13;
development, the field had rapidly gained credibility as a scholarly discipline. Much&#13;
uncharted territory still exists, and many legal issues remain to be explored. Thus,&#13;
it provides fertile ground for research. It is also a crucial area for practitioners. In&#13;
many farm states, problems connected with agriculture make up over half the work&#13;
of lawyers, and in other states the proportion of time devoted to agriculture is significant.&#13;
49 Practitioners are therefore eager to expand their knowledge of the legal&#13;
problems of agriculture. And for the future, students (o f ten those with farm backgrounds)&#13;
have realized the opportunity that this new field presents. Moreover, we&#13;
now have a vibrant professional organization to guide us in our efforts.&#13;
Agricultural law in the United States is a young discipline that offers an opportunity&#13;
to make significant contributions. It is clear, moreover, that the contributions&#13;
of agricultural lawyers are not merely academie.&#13;
Ultimately, agricultural lawyers, in the United States as in the Netherlands, can help&#13;
to facilitate the continued production of agricultural commodities to feed our nations&#13;
and the world.</content><legacyfootnotes>1. K. Meyer, D. Pedersen, N. Thorson, J. Davidson, Agricultural Law: Cases and Materials xvii (1985)&#13;

It must be recognized, however, that in recent years American agriculture has experienced rapid segmentation.&#13;
A small number of large farms (one percent) account for 25 to 30 percent of the value of United&#13;
States farm production and an even larger proportion of net farm income. See Looney, Agricultural Law&#13;

the same subject, or federal objectives and obligations that indicate a purpose to exclude state law. Id.&#13;
16. Id. at 184.&#13;
17. E.g., Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 464 U.S. 238, 104 S. Ct. 615, 626 (1984); Kewanee Oil Co.&#13;
v. Bicron Corp. 416 U.S. 470 (1974).&#13;
18. Although some federal environmental laws reflect a federal intention to exclude states from regulating,&#13;
at least to some degree, others envision concurrent regulation and the continuing availability of state&#13;
remedies at least as stringent as federal requirements. Some state regulation is excluded, for example,&#13;
in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 136-136y (1982 &amp; Supp. II 1984)&#13;
(especially § 136v). The Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251-1376 (1982 &amp; Supp. II 1984) envisions con&#13;
current regulation by federal and state governments.&#13;
19. See Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. Regulatory Federalism: Policy, Process,&#13;
Impact and Reform 82-83, 87-90 (1984). Other forms of intergovernmental regulation include direct or&#13;
ders (rarely used), crosscutting requirements (imposed on federal grants to further social and economie&#13;
policies), and crossover sanctions (fiscal sanctions in one program area to influence state policy in another).&#13;
Id. at 7-9. Environmental protection programs also have elements of these other forms of inter&#13;
governmental regulation.&#13;
20. Some feel that this approach 'commandeers' the decisionmaking process of state governments, reducing&#13;
state capacity for choice. Id. at 35-36.&#13;
21. See 1 J. Juergensmeyer and J. Wadley, Agricultural Law 3 (1981) (hereinafter cited as J. Juergensmeyer)&#13;
for the view that 'agricultural operations and activities' must be interpreted broadly, to in&#13;
clude production, processing, storage, and marketing of agricultural commodities.&#13;
22. K. Meyer, supra note 1, at xx.&#13;
23. See Harl, supra note 7, at 541, for the idea that land carries with it a certain mystique.&#13;
24. K. Meyer, supra note 1, at xx.&#13;
25. See id., at 6-7. For example, right to farm laws abrogate common law nuisance principles to protect&#13;
some farming operations.&#13;
26. This example is designed to suggest the general types of regulation that govern farm operations.&#13;
Thus, the example makes no attempt to be specific or comprehensive.&#13;
27. In the area of agricultural labor, however, numerous exemptions apply to farmers with small operations.&#13;
28. Congress recently enacted a federal provision that affected state law dealing with sale of farm prod&#13;
ucts subject to a security interest. See Meyer, Agricultural Credit and the Uniform Commercial Code:&#13;
A Needfor Change?, 34 Kan. L. Rev. 469 (1986).&#13;
29. J. Juergensmeyer, supra note 21, at. 4.&#13;
30. These factors are listed in Kershen, Symposium Introduction, 21 S.D. L. Rev. 479 (1976).&#13;
31. J. Juergensmeyer, supra note 21, at 4. Agricultural law may have evolved slowly as a discipline because&#13;
people failed to recognize the close entanglement of agriculture with law. Id. at 5-6.&#13;
32. Id. at 4. The development has been somewhat analogous to the growth of environmental law as a&#13;
discipline during the 1960s and 1970s.&#13;
33. For a more detailed explication of this history, see Uchtmann, Book Review, 66 Iowa L. Rev. 665&#13;
(1981).&#13;
34. H.Willis, Farmers' Manual of Law (1911).&#13;
35. Each state has its own College of Agriculture, which is normally part of the state land grant universi&#13;
ty.&#13;
36. The University of Wisconsin was probably the next to institute an agricultural law course, in 1947.&#13;
See Uchtmann, supra note 33, at 672.&#13;

38. For an accounting of some actual numbers, see Uchtmann, supra note 33, at 668-671.&#13;
39. For example, the South Dakota Law Review published a symposium in 1974 and annually thereafter.&#13;
40. For a recent example, see volume 34, no. 3 of the Kansas Law Review (Spring 1986), which is devoted&#13;
entirely to a symposium on agricultural law.&#13;
41. The annual volumes are numbered 1979-80 through 1982-83.&#13;
42. The journal begins with volume 5 (1983-84).&#13;

legal practice.</legacyfootnotes><footnotes><footnote/></footnotes><auteurs>Prof. dr Margaret Rosso Grossman</auteurs><published>1987-03-01 00:00:00</published><modified>1987-03-01 00:00:00</modified><editiondate>1987-03-01</editiondate><htmlpath>https://denhollander.info/artikel/6316</htmlpath></article>
