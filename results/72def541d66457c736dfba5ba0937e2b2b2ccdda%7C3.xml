of a number of programs designed to protect valuable agricultural land from&#13;
unnecessary conversion to nonagricultural uses, to protect especially fragile land&#13;
from a gradual loss of productivity through erosion and other causes, or to retain&#13;
the nature and landscape values that inhere in some land used for farming. Continued&#13;
attention to these programs remains important, even in the face of surplus production&#13;
of farm products in the European Community, the United States, and elsewhere.&#13;
The quantity of agricultural land is finite, and that land will continue to be&#13;
an essential component in the production of food and fiber. Moreover, many of the&#13;
natural values connected with agricultural land will be lost permanently, without&#13;
protection.&#13;
The nature of the programs to protect agricultural land varies from nation to nation&#13;
(and even in states or other governmental subdivisions within a nation), depending&#13;
in part on the amount of productive agricultural land, the severity of threats to&#13;
that land, the legal mechanisms available to mitigate those threats, and public and&#13;
governmental attitudes towards farmland.&#13;
The Netherlands has demonstrated an unusual commitment to agricultural land.&#13;
Because its dense population and intensive agriculturel industry require optimal use&#13;
of limited land resources, The Netherlands has adopted relatively stringent measures&#13;
to control and allocate the consumption of its land. Comprehensive physical planning,&#13;
governed by the Wet op de ruimtelijke ordening, demonstrates a national commitment&#13;
to sound planning and management in rural areas. Bestemmingsplannen&#13;
provide the opportunity for municipalities to allocate land for continued agricultural&#13;
or nature protection uses. Development of polders, most notably through the&#13;
IJsselmeer project, has resulted in significant additions to the amount of productive&#13;
agricultural land. And landinrichting, involving rationalization of land ownership&#13;
patterns as well as other improvements in farm conditions, attempts to improve&#13;
agriculture structure, while at the same time recognizing other important claims on&#13;
rural areas. Moreover, special programs (for example, the implementation of Relatienota&#13;
policy through management agreements) and laws are available to protect&#13;
nature and landscape values, including important habitats for flora and fauna. It is evident that most of the Dutch programs affecting agricultural land involve the national&#13;
government in some significant way.</inleiding><content>In contrast, in the United States, issues concerning land use have traditionally&#13;
been within the legislative competence of state, rather than federal, government.1&#13;
Thus, many (though certainly not all) of the most significant legislative measures&#13;
connected with the protection of agricultural land have been enacted by state governments&#13;
or by local governments pursuant to power delegated by the states.&#13;
Legislation preserving agricultural land in the United States is often directed toward&#13;
the broad goal of protecting prime and otherwise unique farmland from unnecessary&#13;
conversion to nonagricultural uses. Sometimes, however, individual legislative&#13;
schemes demonstrate more specific goals; these suggest that agricultural land&#13;
protection in the U.S. has both long-term and short-term components.2&#13;
One objective of agricultural land preservation is to provide for orderly development&#13;
in urban fringe areas; that is, to avoid the premature departure of agricultural&#13;
operations from areas not yet ripe for development. This approach reduces development&#13;
costs because it helps avoid situations in which productive land is idle and random&#13;
growth consumes farmland. Legislation with this orderly development objective&#13;
does not always strive to preserve agricultural land permanently.&#13;
Another objective is to preserve farmland as a scarce and valuable natural resource&#13;
essential to succeeding generations. The goal is not merely to postpone conversion&#13;
to ensure orderly development; instead, legislation reflecting this objective attempts&#13;
to protect farmland permanently.&#13;
A further objective sometimes evident in the U.S., as in Holland, is to ensure the&#13;
continued existence of open space areas in urban settings. Open space enhances the&#13;
quality of life and adds value to existing urban development.&#13;
These goals of orderly development, permanent farmland preservation, and open&#13;
space are pursued through various types of farmland preservation programs. In many&#13;
parts of the U.S., voluntary programs form the main means of protecting productive&#13;
farmland from irrevocable development. A number of these provide special&#13;
benefits and legal protections to owners who keep their land in agricultural use. For&#13;
example, incentives for farmland preservation offered through legislation include&#13;
reduced real estate taxes, limited immunity from nuisance suits, and protection from&#13;
some intrusive municipal ordinances.&#13;
Some farmland preservation schemes in the U.S., as in The Netherlands, are mandatory.&#13;
Like ruimtelijke ordening, zoning has the potential to prevent the conversion&#13;
of farmland to nonagricultural uses. In some localities, municipal or county zoning&#13;
regulations identify areas for agricultural use. In recent years, exclusive agricultural&#13;
use zoning (permitting only agricultural uses, with farm dwellings and buildings,&#13;
of specified land) has received more attention. Nonetheless, zoning is often viewed as a function of municipalities, which (unlike in Holland) do not encompass&#13;
the surrounding countryside. Thus, large areas of agricultural land are simply not&#13;
regulated by zoning. Often development in the countryside can occur relatively easily.&#13;
Two types of farmland protection legislation enacted by American states are particularly&#13;
interesting, because they involve incentives available for specifically identified&#13;
parcels of agricultural land. These are commonly referred to as agricultural districts&#13;
and conservation easements. Both are legislative reflections of state public policy&#13;
that encourages the retention of farmland in agricultural use, either permanently&#13;
or for a more limited time period. Each type of program has been enacted in a number&#13;
of states in an attempt to create land reserves where agriculture is the primary&#13;
activity. Largely effective on a voluntary basis, each program restricts the land use&#13;
of participating landowners and in return offers incentives for participation.&#13;
Agricultural districts are designed to prevent the premature departure of farming&#13;
from the urban fringe, by offering special protection to farmers who choose to participate.&#13;
Because the districts are established for specific time periods, they foster&#13;
the orderly development objective of farmland preservation schemes.&#13;
Conservation easements and related programs are normally intended to ensure the&#13;
long-term preservation of farmland. Under these programs, the right to develop the&#13;
land is separated permanently from ownership. In this way, neither the current&#13;
owner nor any future owners of the land can convert the property to nonagricultural&#13;
use.&#13;
AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS&#13;
The purpose of agricultural district (sometimes called agricultural area) legislation&#13;
is to prevent the premature end of farming on the urban fringe, or in other vulnerable&#13;
localities, by offering a number of protections to the agricultural operations&#13;
of farmers in that fringe.3 These protections are intended to offset uncertainties faced&#13;
by farmers in areas of urban growth and to alleviate problems encountered when&#13;
the character of the community surrounding farmland changes from rural to urban.&#13;
4 By encouraging establishment of districts in which the primary land use is&#13;
farming, agricultural district legislation also attempts to achieve efficiënt development&#13;
by directing new growth toward existing vacant parcels instead of toward vulnerable&#13;
and productive agricultural land. Most of the agricultural district laws effective in American states5 have been&#13;
enacted since 1965. Although the laws differ from state to state, they tend to follow&#13;
a rather similar pattern.6 Agricultural districts are formed voluntarily on the initiative&#13;
of a farmer or group of farmers. Typically, any owner or owners of land may&#13;
submit a petition to create a district to the local governing body, usually a county&#13;
authority.7 No land can be included in a district without the owner's consent, and&#13;
a district must include a minimum number of acres.8 The authority receiving the&#13;
petition must hold a hearing and act to approve or reject the petition within a limited&#13;
time period. Once approved, the agricultural district is established for a specified&#13;
time period (typically ten years).&#13;
During the time the district exists, agriculture is to be the only (or sometimes the&#13;
primary) activity conducted on land within the district. Subject to government approval,&#13;
owners may withdraw land from the district during the period, but the remaining&#13;
part of the district continues undisturbed. After expiration of the original&#13;
term, the district may be dissolved completely on request of a portion of the landowners.&#13;
If there is no request for dissolution, the district continues, again for a limited&#13;
period of time.&#13;
To promote the formation of agricultural districts, these laws give special protections&#13;
to farmers with land in districts. The protections vary from state to state, but&#13;
several types are typical. For example, farmers in an agricultural district usually receive&#13;
relief from inflated real property taxes; their land is taxed as if farming were&#13;
the highest and best use, and the development potential is not taxed.9 In addition,&#13;
farmers in districts may receive protection from local ordinances that restrict and&#13;
regulate farming activities and structures. Such ordinances (for example, limiting&#13;
use of pesticides or establishing other restrictions that hinder farming) are sometimes&#13;
demanded by urban-minded residents of a formerly rural area. Agricultural&#13;
district legislation therefore often limits the power of local governments to regulate&#13;
agriculture within the district, unless the regulation directly affects public health or&#13;
safety. Further, agricultural district statutes often limit the authority of special purpose districts to impose ad valorem taxes on land within the districts.10 Other protections&#13;
also sometimes accompany agricultural district status.11&#13;
In a few states, a number of these protections are available on an individual,&#13;
rather than a district, basis. Landowners have the opportunity to sign a contract&#13;
restricting development for a specified period (often ten years). In exchange, the farmer&#13;
receives financial benefits, either reduced property taxes or tax credits.12&#13;
Though a rather small number of states (roughly a quarter) have agricultural district&#13;
laws, and many of those are relatively recent, participation has been significant.&#13;
In New York, the state with the oldest agricultural district law, over eight million&#13;
acres (3.24 million hectares) of farmland are enrolled in districts. Other state programs&#13;
are smaller, but in total more than 25 million acres (10.13 million hectares)&#13;
of farmland are protected through these programs.13&#13;
Despite significant benefits and incentives tied to agricultural districts, and notwithstanding&#13;
the large number of acres currently enrolled, these legal devices do not&#13;
prevent the ultimate conversion of farmland to nonagricultural uses. Of course, they&#13;
help to improve the farmer's situation, and thus may encourage the continuation&#13;
of farming indefinitely. But normally they keep agriculture in place untill the protected&#13;
land is truly needed for immediate urban growth. Moreover, as the discussion&#13;
above indicated, participation in agricultural districts is voluntary; owners who are&#13;
willing to sell their land for development may simply refuse to join a district.14&#13;
RESTRICTIONS ON DEVELOPMENT&#13;
Another type of American legislative scheme is designed to protect farmland over&#13;
the long term, while at the same time allowing the farmer to maintain a property&#13;
interest in the land and to pursue normal agricultural activities without restrictions.&#13;
Such programs limit the farmer's right to convert the land to nonfarm use (for&#13;
example, commercial development), but leave intact the right to use the property for&#13;
agricultural purposes. This is accomplished by separating the right to develop the&#13;
land from the underlying ownership of the land itself. Programs permanently severing the right to develop have various titles, including&#13;
conservation easements15, land preservation easements, deed restrictions, and purchase&#13;
of development rights.16 Despite this variety of labels and some differences&#13;
in the operation of the programs, they share the goal of preserving productive agricultural&#13;
land and open space for succeeding generations.&#13;
In essence, these programs authorize purchase of conservation easements or development&#13;
rights on selected parcels of agricultural land.17 Although the legislative&#13;
schemes in the various states are not identical, some generalization about their operation&#13;
is appropriate. Normally, the state legislature creates a committee or other&#13;
body charged with administration of the development rights program. The body has&#13;
authority to consider offers from qualified owners who want to sell (or donate) a&#13;
conservation easement or their development rights. Because the objective is to protect&#13;
the maximum number of acres of prime farmland with the money available,&#13;
some state laws include criteria for identifying the parcels of land that are most vulnerable&#13;
or most valuable and therefore should receive priority for purchase of development&#13;
rights.18&#13;
After the conservation easements or development rights have been acquired pursuant&#13;
to statute, the legislatively-authorized agency holds those rights and enforces&#13;
the preservation restrictions. These rights acquired under a state program are normally&#13;
held in perpetuity19, and the resulting use restrictions bind future owners of&#13;
the farmland. Conservation easements can be terminated, if at all, only through statutory&#13;
procedures when the public interest no longer requires restrictions on development.&#13;
The existence of a conservation easement does not grant right of access&#13;
or use to the general public.&#13;
Owners who convey conservation easements or development rights retain title to&#13;
the land. Farmers may continue to use the property for ordinary agricultural operations,&#13;
but the land may not be developed. Thus landowners who sell conservation easements realize part of the value of the property (that is, the cash value of development&#13;
rights or the easement) without sacrificing their means of livelihood. Those&#13;
who donate, rather than sell, such easements often receive value in the form of a&#13;
federal income tax deduction.&#13;
Conservation easements, like agricultural districts, are usually voluntary agreements.&#13;
Transfer of a conservation easement to the state or another body will occur&#13;
only if the landowner agrees. Farmers are willing to cooperate because they will receive&#13;
compensation for surrendering the right to develop.20 The availability of&#13;
compensation, however, suggests the major difficulty in programs to acquire conservation&#13;
easements or development rights: the cost. The land most vulnerable to&#13;
conversion - that is, land with the most potential for development - has the most&#13;
valuable development rights. Financial constraints thus dictate that these programs&#13;
can protect only a limited number of acres of productive agricultural land. Despite&#13;
the desirability and effectiveness of the conservation easement approach, fewer than&#13;
100,000 acres (40,500 hectares) have been protected through these government programs.&#13;
21&#13;
Conservation easements, as described here, must be distinguished from the 'conservation&#13;
reserve' authorized by the Food Security Act of 1985 and linked with the&#13;
complicated United States price and income support program for agriculture.22&#13;
The conservation reserve is a federal program intended primarily to reduce damage&#13;
and costs from soil erosion, but also to decrease productive capacity and to support&#13;
crop prices.23 It will have the additional effect of protecting wildlife by providing&#13;
protective habitat and reducing the amount of harmful chemicals used on agricultural&#13;
land. Under this program, producers contract with the U.S. government to retire&#13;
'highly erodible' cropland (as defined in implementing regulations) from production for ten years.24 In place of commercial agricultural use of the land, the&#13;
contracts require the planting of conservation cover on the land. Technical help in&#13;
this endeavor is available from state and federal agencies.&#13;
Producers receive annual rental payments for land in the conservation reserve. In&#13;
addition, they receive cost-share payments for up to 50 percent of the cost of establishing&#13;
approved vegetative cover or trees on the conservation reserve land. Farmers&#13;
who return land to production prior to the end of the ten-year contract period&#13;
must repay rental and cost-share payments with interest.&#13;
During announced signup periods, interested farmers may submit a bid to enroll&#13;
land in the reserve. Normally not more than 25 percent of land in any county can&#13;
be bid into the program; this limitation is designed to avoid adverse effects on local&#13;
economies. The program may include up to 45 million acres (18.225 million hectares)&#13;
of eligible cropland by crop year 1990.&#13;
By October 1987, nearly 23 million acres of land were on contract at average rental&#13;
payments of $48.40 per acre per year. Estimates suggest that conservation efforts&#13;
on this land will prevent about 467 million tons of soil erosion annually.25&#13;
The conservation reserve is thus more similar than conservation easements to the&#13;
Dutch beheersovereenkomsten, instruments of Relatienota policy that involve sixyear&#13;
contracts under which landowners promise to tailor their farming practices to&#13;
the needs of nature and landscape. Although their purposes are somewhat different,&#13;
both the conservation reserve and beheersovereenkomsten have the effect of offering&#13;
protection for natural values. The conservation reserve, however, advances nature&#13;
values by taking land out of commercial agricultural production, rather than&#13;
altering farming activities. In addition, both are temporary agreements that leave&#13;
room for flexibility at the conclusion of the contract period. Because that flexibility&#13;
allows the protective measures taken under the contract to be terminated, however,&#13;
it may signal the ultimate failure of the purposes of the agreements. Conservation&#13;
easements, in contrast, offer more certainty of protection: normally their duration&#13;
is perpetual. Yet, as societal needs and environmental values change over the years,&#13;
the permanence of conservation easements may limit land use options by imposing&#13;
the value judgments of the present on future generations. CONCLUSION&#13;
Agricultural districts and conservation easements represent only two of the many&#13;
legal arrangements available in the United States for the protection of farmland.&#13;
Nonetheless, they are important instruments. Agricultural districts offer incentives&#13;
that have encouraged widespread participation, and conservation easements promise&#13;
long-term protection to especially vulnerable land. The voluntary nature of these&#13;
programs means that only those truly committed to continuation of agricultural use&#13;
of their land will participate. Although this may limit the amount of land protected,&#13;
political realities may have dictated this element of voluntary participation. American&#13;
farmers seem more reluctant than Dutch farmers to accept intrusive government&#13;
involvement in land-use decisions; thus, mandatory programs face greater obstacles&#13;
to enactment.&#13;
These programs are neither as successful as ruimtelijke ordening in avoiding undesirable&#13;
development, nor as effective as landinrichting in improving the structure&#13;
of agricultural land. Nonetheless, they represent two of the more successful legal&#13;
means by which America's fertile agricultural land is kept available to provide food,&#13;
fiber, and open space.</content><legacyfootnotes>1. There is little doubt, however, that the federal government enjoys substantial legislative power in this&#13;
area.&#13;
2. The objectives of farmland protection are explained in more detail in Grossman, Exercising Eminent&#13;
Domain against Protected Agricultural Lands: Taking a Second Look, 30 Villanova Law Review 701,&#13;
704-707 (1985). Much of the following discussion of agricultural districts and conservation easements is&#13;
adapted from this article.&#13;
3. Although creation of agricultural districts is not normally limited to the urban fringe, districts serve&#13;
their most useful function in regions pressured by development.&#13;
4. Farmers whose land is ripe for development may hesitate to make essential investments in the farm&#13;
operation, thus suffering a competitive disadvantage. Moreover, transitional areas often lose the seed,&#13;
fertilizer, and implement dealers needed to support farming operations. Sometimes farmers in urbanizing&#13;
areas are assessed higher property taxes than those in truly rural areas. The increased uncertainty, inconvenience,&#13;
and expense of these situations may lead the discouraged farmer to terminate his business and&#13;
sell to developers. See Grossman, supra note 2, at 709-710.&#13;
5. Agricultural district laws have been enacted in California, Illinois, lowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minne&#13;
sota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin. See Grossman, supra note&#13;
2, at 708 n.26 for citations.&#13;
6. For a more complete description of formation procedures, see Grossman, supra note 2, at 710-11 &amp;&#13;
765 n. 311. The description is based on the Illinois Agricultural Areas Conservation and Protection Act.&#13;
111. Rev. Stat. ch. 5, §§ 1001-1020 (1987).&#13;
7. Counties are smaller governmental units that are located within states and derive their governing power&#13;
from the states. They usually include a number of municipalities (towns), as well as the rural areas that&#13;
are not part of any municipality.&#13;
8. In Illinois, for example the minimum size is 350 acres (141.75 hectares), reduced from the original mi&#13;
nimum of 500 acres. See the Illinois Agricultural Areas Conservation and Protection Act, 111. Rev. Stat.,&#13;
ch. 5, §§ 1001-1020 (1987).&#13;
9. That is, land is assessed at agricultural, rather than market, value. Such preferential taxation laws are&#13;
not always tied to agricultural districts; preferential taxation for agricultural land is available in many&#13;
states without agricultural district legislation. Every state has some type of preferential taxation for agri&#13;
cultural land.&#13;
10. Ad valorem taxes are used to finance improved public services, such as light, sewer, water, and nonfarm&#13;
drainage. Farmers, taxed on a per-acre basis, may bear a disproportionate share of the cost of these&#13;
improvements.&#13;
11. For example, some laws direct state departments and agencies to execute programs in ways that en&#13;
courage and support agricultural districts. One state, Minnesota, has prohibited the development of pu&#13;
blic sewer and water systems within certain agricultural districts. See Grossman, supra note 2, at 712-713.&#13;
12. Hiemstra &amp; Bushwick, How States are Saving Farmland, 6 American Land Forum Magazine 60, at&#13;
61-62 (Spring 1986). The authors cite Wisconsin, Michigan, and California, noting that about 26 million&#13;
acres (10.53 million hectares) are enrolled in these programs, which are not really agricultural districts.&#13;
13. Hiemstra &amp; Bushwick, supra note 12, at 62.&#13;
14. The voluntary nature of agricultural districts was probably necessary for their political acceptability.&#13;
See Conklin &amp; Bryant, Agricultural Districts: A Compromise Approach to Agricultural Preservation, 56&#13;
Am. J. Agric. Econ. 607, 607 (1974). American farmers view voluntary programs much more favorably&#13;
than mandatory programs. This factor may be instrumental in the initial enactment of any farmland pre&#13;
servation law.&#13;
15. A conservation easement is 'a less-than-fee interest in real property that gives the holder the right&#13;
to prevent certain activities on the land, usually the construction of dwellings and other structures.'&#13;
Thompson, Local Planning Efforts to Encourage Private Land Conservation, 9 Zoning and Planning&#13;
Law Report 25, 26 (1986).&#13;
16. States with conservation easement and related laws include Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts,&#13;
Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Yersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia. See&#13;
Grossman, supra note 2, at 716 n.66 for citations.&#13;
A majority of states have laws called 'conservation easement' acts. Rather than establishing a program&#13;
for purchase of development rights on selected agricultural property, like the laws discribed in this article,&#13;
these state laws eliminate certain common law impediments to enforcement of an 'easement in gross'&#13;
(that is, an easement that conveys benefits to the holder of the easement personally, rather than in connection&#13;
with the holder's land). See, e.g., Uniform Conservation Easement Act, 12 Uniform Laws Annotated&#13;
54, 55 (Supp. 1987), which states clearly that it has the narrow purpose of avoiding impediments&#13;
to the effectiveness of conservation easements in gross.&#13;
17. In addition, some local government programs for purchase of development rights exist. Moreover,&#13;
several private, nonprofit organizations, formed to encourage agricultural land preservation, act inde&#13;
pendently of state and local programs to acquire development rights and conservation easements. Such&#13;
organizations have succeeded in permanent protection of over 460,000 acres. See Thompson, supra note&#13;
15, at 25.&#13;
18. In Connecticut, for example, factors include the probability that the land will be sold for nonagricultural&#13;
purposes, the productivity of the land, soil classification and other indications of agricultural suita&#13;
bility, contribution to the agricultural potential of the state, encumbrances, and costs of acquiring de&#13;
velopment rights. Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 22-26cc(a) (West Supp. 1987).&#13;
19. Some states have shorter-term programs. For example, in Minnesota, a number of 10-year restric&#13;
tions on development exist. See 6 Farmland notes (January 1987).&#13;
20. Agricultural land could be protected through exclusive agricultural zoning, which uses regulation pur&#13;
suant to the police power to prohibit development of agricultural land and does not require compensation&#13;
to the landowner. Zoning, however, is not immune either to judicial challenge or to political pressure.&#13;
21. Hiemstra &amp; Bush wick, Saving Farmland, supra note 12, at 63.&#13;
The Food Security Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-198, 99 Stat. 1354, authorized a federal conservation easement&#13;
program intended to mitigate some burdens of the current agricultural debt crisis. The program&#13;
involves debts owed to the Farmers Home Administration, the federal lender of last resort. Certain borrowers,&#13;
with loans entered before enactment of the Act, may have a portion of their debt to Farmers&#13;
Home cancelled, if they convey an easement in real property for a term of at least 50 years for conservation,&#13;
recreational, and wildlife purposes. Certain cropland that is wetland, upland, or highly erodible,&#13;
and suitable for conservation protection is eligible. The easement entered will specify the purposes for&#13;
which the property may be used and the conservation measures to be taken. 7 U.S.C.A. § 1997 (Supp.&#13;
1987).&#13;
In addition, the Act authorizes Farmers Home to grant conservation easements to government bodies&#13;
or nonprofit organizations on land the agency has repossessed from defaulting borrowers. 7 U.S.C.A.&#13;
§ 1985(c) (Supp. 1987).&#13;
22. The conservation reserve was enacted by the Food Security Act of 1985, and is codified at 16&#13;
U.S.C.A. §§ 3831-3836 (Supp. 1987). Implementing regulations are published at 7 C.F.R. Pt. 704 (1987).&#13;
The Act also initiated programs known as 'sodbuster' and 'swampbuster', designed to discourage far&#13;
mers from bringing highly erodible lands or wetlands into production. Farmers who produce commodi&#13;
ties on highly erodible fields or converted wetlands will be ineligible for certain federal farm program&#13;
benefits. 16 U.S.C.A. §§ 3801, 3811-13, 3821-23 (Supp. 1987).&#13;
23. See Ervin and Blase, The conservation reserve: Potential impacts and problems, 41 J. Soil &amp; Water&#13;
Conservation 77 (1986).&#13;
24. Eventually (for many farms, in 1990), under what is termed 'conservation compliance', farmers who&#13;
plant crops on a field with highly erodible land will be ineligible for U.S. government price support, storage,&#13;
insurance, disaster, and loan programs for any commodity produced that year. Some exceptions apply,&#13;
including an exception for certain land cultivated under an approved conservation plan. 16 U.S.C.A.&#13;
§§ 3811-3813 (Supp. 1987).&#13;
