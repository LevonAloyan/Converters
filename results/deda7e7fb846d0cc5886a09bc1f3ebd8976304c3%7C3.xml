INTRODUCTION&#13;
Danish law on agricultural tenancy is quite different from other European countries - e.g.&#13;
The Netherlands.1 Thus, in The Netherlands you find a detailed legislation - 'de Pachtwet'&#13;
- dealing with matters of both private and public law, restricting the freedom of the&#13;
landlord and the tenant. In Denmark - on the other hand - the freedom of the parties to&#13;
decide the content of their agreements is the dominating principle in agricultural law. So,&#13;
The Danish act on Farms2 lays out only 2 (two) sections on agricultural tenancy.&#13;
But, not only the intensity of the legislation is different. It is very interesting to notice&#13;
that the use of agricultural tenancy has decreased in The Netherlands for the last 30 years&#13;
or more, while it has increased - slowly but constantly - in Denmark.3&#13;
The purpose of this article is to give a short survey of Danish law, describing some of&#13;
the advantages and disadvantages of the very liberal legislation at a time when the passing&#13;
of amendments to 'de Pachtwet' is considered in The Netherlands.</inleiding><content>2. THE ACT ON FARMS AND IT'S SCOPE&#13;
The Act on Farms' section 11 lays out rules for letting on lease an entire farm. Section 12&#13;
concerns only parts of a farm.&#13;
The purpose of the sections is to limit the use of agricultural tenancy. Thus, the act lays&#13;
out a maximum duration of 30 years for all leases.4 This limitation is closely connected&#13;
with the rules applying to the buying of farm land in Denmark and with the agricultural&#13;
policy of The Danish Government: The farm land is considered as a limited resource of&#13;
nature and as such it should be used for agricultural purposes in the best possible way,&#13;
cultivated by fulltime employed and well-educated farmers. See section 1, subsections 1&#13;
and 2 in The Act on Farms.&#13;
In accordance with this policy the buying of farm land is restricted: The buyer has to&#13;
fulfil some educational conditions, he has to take up permanent residence on the farm&#13;
within 6 months from the day of purchase and he is not allowed to buy if he and/or his&#13;
wife and children younger than 18 years of age own another farm or a part of a farm - see The Act on Farms' section 16, subsection 1. However, some exemptions are given in subsection&#13;
3.&#13;
The purpose of section 16 is to reserve the use of the farm land for professional farmers&#13;
with an agricultural education and to prevent townsmen from buying and using the&#13;
land for recreation or for hobby farming. The educational conditions also assure an&#13;
appropriate cultivation of the land5. The condition of permanent residence prevents&#13;
townsmen from buying farm land if they do not want to live in the country-side. The&#13;
owner living in the towns could lead to a damaging use of the land. Furthermore, there&#13;
is a risk of the land being bought by investors and let on lease to farmers for a high&#13;
rent.6 Investments are also controlled by the limitation in the number of farms the buyer&#13;
and his family are allowed to own.&#13;
The purpose of limiting the use of tenancy, is first of all to prevent the parties getting&#13;
round the above mentioned rules e.g. by letting the land on lease for many years. Thus, a&#13;
50 year irrevocable lease would be almost the same as if the tenant owned the land. So, it&#13;
is necessary that the rules on purchase and tenancy are co-ordinated. Below is given a&#13;
survey of the rules on tenancy and their connection with the rules on purchase.&#13;
If a person wants to lease an entire farm he must fulfil the conditions laid out by The&#13;
Act on Farms' Section 11, subsection 1, meaning that the tenant must:&#13;
1) be 18 years or older. If he is younger he needs the permission of his parents or his&#13;
legal guardian;&#13;
2) be a citizen in one of the member states of the EEC;&#13;
3) fulfil certain educational conditions if the area of the land let on lease is larger than&#13;
30 hectares.7 In this way the educational conditions correspond with those in section 16&#13;
and prevents a buyer getting round the conditions by a long term lease. If the land let on&#13;
lease is smaller than 30 hectares, but the total amount of land cultivated by the tenant ex&#13;
ceeds 30 hectares, he must fulfil the educational conditions as well;&#13;
4) take up permanent residence on the farm that he leases or on his own farm, if it is&#13;
not situated more than 10 kilometres away from the leased land. This is in order to pre&#13;
vent townsmen from leasing farm land, using it for recreative purposes or hobby farming;&#13;
5) not run more than 5 farms or parts of farms at the same time. The purpose of this&#13;
condition is to avoid a few persons getting all the farm land at their disposal by making&#13;
up numerous leases.&#13;
Some further requirements are laid out by section 11, subsection 3: Leases concerning&#13;
an entire farm must be in writing - verbal agreements are illegal. In the lease must be&#13;
given information on the duration, on the terms of notice and on the rent agreed on by the&#13;
parties. This is supposed to make leases clear and comprehensible, which is especially&#13;
important when concerning an entire farm because large amounts of money are involved.&#13;
If one or more of these conditions are not fulfilled the agreement is illegal and both the&#13;
landlord and the tenant could be fined (see section 33) unless an exemption is given by&#13;
the Minister of Agriculture. However, the lease can not be declared null and void. Section 12 in The Act on Farms concerning parts of a farm is less restrictive than section&#13;
11. The most important part (subsection 1, no. 1) - concerning larger parts of land&#13;
with or without buildings - repeats some of the conditions laid out by section 11. Thus,&#13;
the tenant has to fulfil the conditions mentioned above under number 1, 2, 4 and 5. However,&#13;
the conditions in section 11, subsection 3 are not repeated. This means that a lease&#13;
concerning only a part of a farm, does not have to be in writing and the parties do not&#13;
have to give any information on the duration, on the terms of notice or on the agreed rent.&#13;
The practical problems caused by these differences are discussed below.&#13;
If the tenant does not fulfil the conditions, the consequences are the same as apply to&#13;
section 11.&#13;
These conditions are the only ones laid out by The Act on Farms. So, the parties are&#13;
free to make agreements on all other subjects e.g. the minimum duration of the lease,&#13;
what rent to pay etc., as long as the lease is not against other parts of the legislation or the&#13;
public order. The Act on Farms does not grant the parties any special rights like e.g. a&#13;
right of prolongation or a right of economic compensation for improvements made on the&#13;
farm by the tenant.&#13;
3. ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF A LIBERAL TENANCY LEGISLATION&#13;
Like almost any legislation, The Act on Farms both causes and solves problems. Below is&#13;
given a description of some of the main advantages and disadvantages of The Act.&#13;
3.7. Advantages&#13;
The advantages of the liberal legislation are quite obvious: It causes an increase in the use&#13;
of agricultural tenancy. Even though the purpose of The Act on Farms is to limit the use&#13;
of tenancy, the increase must be considered as an advantage. After all it is not the purpose&#13;
of the act to abolish all use of tenancy.&#13;
The increase produces several advantages. First of all tenancy makes it possible for a&#13;
farmer to obtain the best possible agricultural structure. If a farm is too small for a certain&#13;
type of farming, it is possible to make it larger by leasing more land. Buying more land is&#13;
expensive and not always possible. Therefore, an increase in the use of tenancy could indicate&#13;
an improvement of the agricultural structure in Denmark. Furthermore, tenancy&#13;
makes it possible for a farmer to fulfil special demands set up by the legislation for his&#13;
production. E.g. the amounts of milk and manure that the farmer is allowed to produce -&#13;
without having to pay extra taxes - are proportional to the size of his farm. So, if a farmer&#13;
wants to expand his farm in order to avoid extra taxes or simply to obtain the economic&#13;
advantages of large-scale fanning, it is convenient - and in Denmark rather inexpensive -&#13;
to do so by leasing the land. On the other hand a restrictive legislation would limit the&#13;
farmers' chances of adapting their farms to the requirements of the legislation and/or the&#13;
chances of extending and improving the production.&#13;
Finally, agricultural tenancy makes it easier for young farmers to start their own agricultural&#13;
production. To buy land requires a lot of money, which can be difficult to raise&#13;
for a young farmer. It is much easier to raise money to pay the rent. So, the Danish legislation has obvious advantages. But, it must be pointed out that The&#13;
Act on Farms is not the only reason for the increase in the use of tenancy. E.g. the EEC&#13;
legislation on milk forces many farmers to lease land if they want to expand their production&#13;
of milk. A lot of different factors determine the use of tenancy - The Act on Farms&#13;
only being one of them.&#13;
3.2. Disadvantages&#13;
However, the liberal legislation causes problems as well. In fact the extended freedom of&#13;
the parties means that many problems remain unsolved, either because the parties do not&#13;
consider every detail when making the lease or because the legislation gives no solution&#13;
to specific problems. Below is given a description of three of the major disadvantages of&#13;
the liberal legislation. These are not the only problems; but to cover them all is impossible&#13;
on these few pages.&#13;
The form of the lease&#13;
As mentioned above, leases concerning a part of a farm could be verbal. In practice this&#13;
causes problems for the administrative authorities and for the parties. For the supervision&#13;
on leases carried out by the administrative authorities it is of major importance, that as&#13;
many leases as possible are in writing. If any authority finds out about a verbal agreement&#13;
it would be almost impossible to decide whether it complies with the Act or not. It would&#13;
be very easy for the parties - if they wanted to get round the Act - to inform the authorities&#13;
of an agreement with a legal content and then in practice act against The Act on&#13;
Farms. Of course, an illegal arrangement only exists as long as the parties agree. If one of&#13;
the parties - e.g. the tenant - no longer accepts the illegal terms, he could turn to the&#13;
authorities, to get them changed. But in Denmark both parties could be fined if they have&#13;
agreed on an illegal lease (see section 33 in The Act on Farms). So, there has to be a&#13;
fairly good reason for one of them turning to the authorities. Furthermore, the pressure&#13;
from neighbours and the fear of social isolation would often prevent an unsatisfied tenant&#13;
from doing so.&#13;
The supervision is also insufficient because the parties are not obliged to notify any&#13;
public authority about their agreement or to register the lease in The Land Registry. In&#13;
this way, the authorities are normally not informed when farm land is let on lease. This&#13;
makes the supervision quite restrained and accidental. Very often it is only carried out if&#13;
the authorities come across a lease for some special reason: By accident or if the tenant&#13;
wants to register the lease in The Land Registry. 8&#13;
A verbal lease is not very convenient for the parties either. It is informal and unclear.&#13;
This means that the risk of unexpected problems occurring is considerable and the parties&#13;
often have different views about what was originally agreed on. Disagreements about&#13;
even minor problems - which could have been solved in a single line in a written lease -&#13;
can easily - and do often - lead to the end of the tenancy agreement, causing heavy&#13;
damage to either one or both of the parties. Furthermore, the inconsequent sections in the act lead to some quite irrational results.&#13;
The size of the area which can be let on lease as a part of a farm is not limited by The Act&#13;
on Farms section 12. E.g. all the land without the buildings could legally be let on lease&#13;
as a part of a farm. Therefore very large areas can be let on lease by an informal, verbal&#13;
agreement involving large amounts of money. Furthermore, it is possible for the parties to&#13;
make two different verbal agreements: One concerning the land and another concerning&#13;
the buildings. Both agreements are only concerning a part of a farm. This would of course&#13;
be an attempt to get round The Act on Farms' section 12 because the leases actually concern&#13;
an entire farm. But it would be very difficult for the authorities to provide sufficient&#13;
evidence for the existence of both agreements and to prove that they are illegal. In this&#13;
way the parties could get round the conditions in section 11.&#13;
So, it is possible to make agreements on very similar objects where one of the agreements&#13;
has to be in writing while the other one could be verbal. It is difficult to understand&#13;
how an insignificant difference of fact in some cases can be the reason for the significant&#13;
difference laid out by the Act. The purposes of the demand of written leases on entire&#13;
farms, are to prevent disagreements between the parties, to create clear leases and to prevent&#13;
loss of money for the parties. The same purposes seem to apply quite well to leases&#13;
concerning (large) parts of farms as well. But, why are the conditions different then?&#13;
In practice verbal leases appear frequently. Whether they are legal or not, they cause&#13;
problems for the parties and the authorities.9 If verbal tenancy agreements were banned,&#13;
the problems would be minimized. Furthermore, the authorities ought to be given better&#13;
possibilities to perform the supervision of leases. Today it is too easy to get round the&#13;
Act. (Or section 11 and 12 should be totally repealed since they make no sense if the supervision&#13;
is too insufficient.)&#13;
Maintenance of the farm let on lease&#13;
The subject most often causing problems in Denmark is probably the maintenance of the&#13;
farm. Who is to be in charge of and to pay for repairs etc.?&#13;
In despite of the fact that the question arises in relation to many leases, Danish law&#13;
does not deal with it like e.g. 'de Pachtwet', § 6. Of course the problem is of a limited&#13;
nature if the parties themselves solve it in the lease. That happens, but a very large percentage&#13;
of the leases makes only this division:&#13;
'The tenant is in charge of and pays for the usual maintenance of the soil and the buildings&#13;
while the landlord is obliged to reconstruct the buildings in case they burn down.&#13;
The landlord alone decides the position of the new buildings'.&#13;
Often the obligation of the landlord is limited even more, so that he only has to reconstruct&#13;
the buildings if he finds it appropriate - without any regard to the tenant's needs.&#13;
Reading this agreement, it seems as if the obligations of the tenant are almost unlimited.&#13;
The words 'usual maintenance' could cover any form of repair etc. except the reconstruction&#13;
of buildings burned down. However, in practice the duties are often shared by&#13;
the parties to a considerable degree. But it might be very difficult to decide which one of&#13;
the parties is to pay for the repair of a specific damage if they do not agree and a stipulation&#13;
like the one mentioned above is the only means of interpretation. Danish courts have been dealing with some of the problems, at least in the first half of&#13;
this century. It seems as if they have tried to evolve some general principles - but only&#13;
five decisions have been published - the latest in 1941. So, the work is not at all completed&#13;
and the leases dealt with in the five decisions are in some ways old-fashioned compared&#13;
to modern leases.&#13;
Apparently the courts have tried to split up the maintenance into two groups: The usual&#13;
and the extraordinary forms of maintenance. This division is very similar to the one used&#13;
in most modern leases but the courts give a little more explicit formulation of what is&#13;
meant by 'usual maintenance': The tenant has to keep the farm in good condition during&#13;
the entire period of leasing. In order to do so, the tenant has to carry out all necessary repairs&#13;
and mending, e.g. paint the buildings, fertilize the soil and spray with herbicides&#13;
when necessary. In other words, all the daily work which has to be done in order to keep&#13;
the farm in a good condition is 'usual maintenance' and must be carried out and/or paid&#13;
for by the tenant. In this way there are some similarities between Danish case law and art.&#13;
25 in 'de Pachtwet'.&#13;
The lower limit of the usual maintenance seems to be the deteriorations of the farm&#13;
caused by the ravages of time and which occur at all farms whether they are let on lease&#13;
or not. But 'the ravages of time' is very difficult to define and only very few hints have&#13;
been given by the courts.&#13;
The upper limit is even more diffuse because the courts in only one case have decided&#13;
on the extraordinary forms of maintenance. Thus, in a decision from 1907, it was decided&#13;
that a landlord had to pay for the reconstruction of a building which burned down after&#13;
being struck by lightning. The court found that the damages were so extraordinary and&#13;
had nothing to do with the tenant keeping the farm in good condition that they were at the&#13;
risk of the landlord. But, presumably the duties of the landlord go beyond the repair of&#13;
damages caused by nature.&#13;
However, the only certain conclusion is that the smallest and the largest repairs have to&#13;
be paid by the landlord. Repairs in between are to be paid by the tenant. But the limits are&#13;
very diffuse and doubt easily and often occurs.&#13;
Difficult problems arise because of the missing legislation and the sparse case law.&#13;
This happens e.g. in relation to the maintenance of the drainpipes. Normally, the tenant&#13;
has to pay for the repair of one or two pipes and the landlord has to pay if a total replacement&#13;
of the drainpipes is needed because this is extraordinary maintenance. But what&#13;
happens if e.g. 1/3 of the pipes needs to be renewed? In Danish law there is no plain answer&#13;
to this question. And because most disputes between parties are settled by arbitration&#13;
no new case law turns up, since the arbitration awards are not public like the court decisions.&#13;
Therefore, the Danish law is actually not developing at all in this field; it is stuck&#13;
where it was more than 50 years ago. So, the answer is very much depending on the&#13;
circumstances.&#13;
Finally, some landlords try to take advantage of the tenant by imposing unreasonable&#13;
burdens of maintenance on him, knowing that the sparse legislation does not prevent it.&#13;
Thus, leases occur, which impose almost every kind of maintenance on the tenant. The&#13;
costs of this can be difficult to foresee because a damage often happens very sudden,&#13;
causing heavy economic strain to the tenant.&#13;
Of course, it is very difficult to deal with all the different types of maintenance of a&#13;
farm in a single act. But it seems to be possible - and a good idea as well - to enact some statutes dealing with the most common situations. In this way problems could be reduced&#13;
to a minimum of unusual situations only occurring rarely. E.g. statutes on the&#13;
maintenance of drainpipes and buildings would be a good idea, because these often cause&#13;
problems.&#13;
The tenant's right to claim prolongation of the lease.&#13;
A very important part of 'de Pachtwet' is § 7 which lays out rules on the prolongation of&#13;
the lease. Similar rules are also known in other European countries. But in Danish law&#13;
they do not exist. Furthermore, the rules seem quite strange because of the important role&#13;
the freedom of the parties is playing in Danish agricultural law. A right for the tenant to&#13;
claim prolongation without the landlord having agreed does not fit in with this freedom.&#13;
The fact that rules on prolongation are unfamiliar to Danish law, it does not necessarily&#13;
mean that there is no need for such rules at all. The reasons for the right of prolongation&#13;
are combinations of social and economic considerations. The tenant's social and economic&#13;
conditions are often depending on the tenancy. If the lease ends, the tenant and his family&#13;
may have to leave their house and home and give up their only source of income causing&#13;
heavy economic and social losses. Of course these considerations apply in Denmark as&#13;
well, even though no legislation has been enacted. If the tenant has a right to claim&#13;
prolongation, he has a longer respite to adjust his finances and his private life to the end of&#13;
the lease. Moreover, the average duration of a lease in Denmark is 5 years. In this short&#13;
period of time it is not always possible to write off major investments made in the farm.&#13;
Therefore a tenant sometimes might need a longer duration than originally agreed on.&#13;
Since there is no right for the tenant to claim prolongation, he is very dependent on the&#13;
attitude of the landlord towards a continuation or a renewal of the lease. A right of&#13;
prolongation restricts the possibilities of the landlord putting pressure on the tenant. If the&#13;
tenant needs a prolongation, he is more willing to accept unfair conditions demanded by&#13;
the landlord for the new period of leasing because it is normally impossible to find&#13;
another farm to lease (or buy) with a short notice. If the tenant - on the other hand - has a&#13;
right of prolongation the landlord can not put the same pressure on him.&#13;
But, in practice the problems seem to be rather small. One of the reasons is perhaps&#13;
that Danish tenants plan their farming in another way than e.g. Dutch farmers. Danish farmers&#13;
know that a prolongation can not be expected. Therefore they have to try to make&#13;
the period of leasing long enough from the start. Then the need of prolongation only&#13;
occurs quite rarely. But of course it is impossible to take everything into consideration&#13;
when planning the lease. So, too short leases do occur.&#13;
Furthermore, very few tenants inhabit the farm or the part of the farm which they&#13;
lease.10 And very few farmers base their production entirely on land let on lease by a third&#13;
party; most tenants own some land as well. This means that the social effect on the tenant&#13;
and his family caused by the end of the lease is limited because only few tenants have to&#13;
leave their homes with a short notice. So, the need of a social protection of the tenant is&#13;
rather modest. Tenants who inhabit their own farm and only lease some additional land&#13;
are often - but not always - able to manage the end of the lease with limited economical&#13;
losses because they can continue there production on their own land. However, tenants&#13;
who actually get in trouble are not at all protected by the legislation. Not even The&#13;
Danish Act on Rent applies to agricultural tenancy. Therefore, a farmer, who inhabits the buildings of a farm let on lease, is less protected than if he was renting a flat. In fact section&#13;
12, subsection 3 in The Act on Farms overrules the protection given to the lessee by&#13;
The Act on Rent. Thus, the latter does not apply to the buildings on a farm if the landlord&#13;
or people working at the farm need the buildings to live in.&#13;
So, in some - few - cases the protection of the tenant might be inadequate and perhaps&#13;
a limited right to claim prolongation could solve some of the problems. But, it is very important&#13;
to weigh the interests of the landlord in proportion to the interests of the tenant&#13;
before and when enacting such legislation. Too restrictive rules, limiting the freedom of&#13;
the landlord, could easily lead to higher rents because he would want something in return&#13;
for the restricted freedom. Some owners might even choose not to let their land on lease&#13;
if they could not be certain of the lease ending at the time agreed on. Both reactions&#13;
would cause a decrease in the use of tenancy; the size of it depending on how restrictive&#13;
the legislation is. Taken into consideration the experiences learned in other countries, the&#13;
first steps towards a legislation in Denmark must be made with care and consideration. It&#13;
is very likely that many landlords would react very strongly to even minor attempts to&#13;
limit their freedom. It is difficult to estimate the effect of a right of prolongation, but it&#13;
must be taken seriously into consideration that the liberal agricultural legislation and the&#13;
principle of freedom for the parties goes back more than 200 years. Sudden restrictions&#13;
could cause devastating damages to the tenancy market. So, compared with the probably&#13;
small achievements obtained by a legislation, the damages could very well turn out to be&#13;
too heavy.&#13;
The result could be even worse, if the right to claim prolongation is combined with a&#13;
right for the tenant to apply for the replacement of himself with a member of his family.&#13;
'De Pachtwet' art. 49 lays out such a right for the tenant called: 'pachtoverneming'. Thus,&#13;
under Dutch law it is possible for a tenant, who himself can not claim prolongation of the&#13;
lease - e.g. because he is too old (art. 38a) - to turn to 'de pachtkamer' according to art.&#13;
49 and apply for himself being substituted by e.g. his son or wife. Then the new tenant&#13;
(i.e. the son or wife) can claim prolongation11. This system gives the landlord very few&#13;
chances to end a lease.&#13;
In Denmark the tenant can only be replaced by another if the landlord agrees. This&#13;
seems to cause very few - if any - problems. If there is a need for a replacement of the&#13;
tenant, the landlord would often allow it (at least for the current leasing period) and fairly&#13;
often the lease gives the tenant such a right. So, the missing legislation on the subject is&#13;
causing almost no problems. Instead serious problems could occur, if a general right of&#13;
replacement - combined with a right of prolongation - was enacted. Then probably very&#13;
few owners of farm land would let it on lease, being afraid of a very long and unpredictable&#13;
duration. There seems to be no reason at all for enacting such rules in Denmark!&#13;
4. CONCLUSION&#13;
Taken the above mentioned disadvantages into consideration the Danish legislation on&#13;
agricultural tenancy must be recognized as too liberal. The legislation is unable to prevent&#13;
the occurrence and solution of certain important problems. So, there is a need for passing&#13;
an amendment. But - as it has already been pointed out - it is important that this is prepared with most care and consideration - taking the interests of both parties into account&#13;
- in order to avoid a sudden major decrease in the use of tenancy. This especially&#13;
applies to rules on prolongation because almost any advantage obtained by the tenant&#13;
would cause a corresponding or even larger disadvantage for the landlord. It is very difficult&#13;
to find the balance between the parties' interest. Perhaps the landlord could be given&#13;
some compensation for a right of prolongation - e.g. a higher rent - so that the tenant&#13;
would be paying for the social and economic security that he gets. Thus, establishing a&#13;
sort of insurance for the tenant. However, rules on prolongation should only apply to those&#13;
persons who really need the protection: Tenants who live at the farm that they rent and&#13;
tenants who have made large investments in the farm.&#13;
An intervention by the legislator concerning other subjects would presumably cause&#13;
less problems. E.g. some general statutes on the maintenance of the farm would be to the&#13;
benefit of both landlords and tenants because it would make clear their rights and obligations.&#13;
This applies to more consequent statutes on the form and the content of the lease as&#13;
well.&#13;
But, still the main principle in Danish agricultural law is - and will continue to be - the&#13;
freedom of agreement; and good reasons must be given before restricting this freedom.</content><legacyfootnotes>1. Concerning other countries: see e.g. W. Winkler in Agr.R. 1988, p. 471-495.&#13;
2. 'Bekendtgcjirelse af lov om landbrugsejendomme' no. 504 of July 17, 1989. In the rest of the text, this act&#13;
will be referred to as: 'The Act on Farms'.&#13;
3. Thus, in 1985 33,3 percent of the farms were (partly) based on leased land. In 1989 it was 35,6 percent.&#13;
4. See The Act on Farms' section 11, subsection 4 and section 12, subsection 1. The maximum duration has&#13;
changed several times since 1960. Thus, it has been 5, 10 and 15 years. So, when the maximum duration&#13;
was raised to 30 years in 1989, The Act actually became the most liberal ever since it was enacted.&#13;
5. Section 16, subsection 2 lays out an important exemption: Farm land up to an area of 30 hectares can be&#13;
bought by persons without any agricultural education at all.&#13;
6. For the same reason limited and private companies must fulfil the conditions in sections 20 - 22 when&#13;
buying farm land. Thus, e.g. the controlling interest in the company must be held by a person who fulfils&#13;
the conditions in section 16 for buying farm land personally.&#13;
