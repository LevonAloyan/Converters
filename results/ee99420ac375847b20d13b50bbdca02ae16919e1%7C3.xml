Inleiding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, a majority of land is rural -- farms, forests, small communities, rural homes, recreational areas, and other rural amenities. Farmers and other rural residents enjoy the same constitutional rights and protections as other citizens; they are subject to federal and state statutes and regulations and local ordinances. Common law principles, established in court decisions, apply. Rural areas are also the subject of special legislation, often designed to encourage economic development, enhance the quality of rural life, and protect environmental resources, including agricultural land. This Article discusses some measures for rural development in federal agricultural legislation, focusing on programs with analogies to EU legislation. &lt;/p&gt;</inleiding><content>&lt;h3&gt;2. Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.1. US Agricultural Legislation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, federal agricultural statutes (Farm Bills), supplemented by other statutes and implemented by regulations, establish policy for agriculture and related areas. The US Congress enacts a Farm Bill every few years, and each Farm Bill applies until its provisions expire (or are extended) and a new statute is enacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Agricultural Act of 2014,[2] the most recent US Farm Bill, governs many, but not all, aspects of agriculture and nutrition assistance through 2018. Enacted after long and contentious debate, the Farm Bill amended prior legislation, repealed some programs, and established new programs. Its twelve Titles govern commodities, conservation, trade and food aid, nutrition, farm credit, rural development, research and extension, forestry, energy, horticulture, crop insurance, and other subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a significant change to US commodity programs, Title I of the 2014 Farm Bill repealed producer support from Direct and Counter-Cyclical payments and ended the Average Crop Revenue Election program.[3] New crop insurance programs, Price Loss Coverage and two types of Agricultural Risk Coverage, provide income support for commodity producers of program crops.[4] These complex programs are beyond the scope of this Article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Title VI of the 2014 Farm Bill governs rural development, primarily through programs that support infrastructure in rural areas -- for example, water systems, waste disposal, solid waste management, business development, loans for public entities, rural telecommunications, high-speed internet service, transportation, technology transfer, and other programs. The provisions of this Rural Development Title do not parallel those in EU Regulation 1305/2013.[5] Other Titles of the 2014 Farm Bill govern activities -- e.g., conservation, forestry -- supported in the EU by Regulation 1305/2013. Title II, for example, continues and amends conservation programs; Title VIII governs Forestry. In addition, permanent legislation governs other aspects of rural development, including rural housing and utilities services, not discussed in this Article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.2. Rural Development&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rural development has played an important role in the United States since the 1930s.[6] Beginning in 1973, each US Farm Bill has included a separate Title that governs rural and community economic development. As fewer rural residents are employed in agriculture, and most farm household income is off-farm, a healthy rural economy and a modern physical infrastructure are critical.[7] Indeed, in USDA’s Strategic Plan for 2014-2018, the first strategic goal is to ‘assist rural communities to create prosperity so they are self-sustaining, repopulating, and economically thriving.’[8] Objectives of this strategic goal are to enhance rural prosperity (infrastructure, education, and economic development); to increase agricultural opportunities (a farm safety net, new domestic and international markets, and a ‘financially sustainable and competitive agricultural system’); and to expand the bioeconomy (renewable energy, biobased products).[9] The US Department of Agriculture is the lead agency for rural development, but almost 90 programs ‘administered by 16 different federal agencies target rural economic development.’[10]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rural development and other government programs define rural areas and farms differently. At least 15 different definitions of ‘rural,’ 11 from USDA, have applied.[11] Census Bureau definitions focus on population size and density. Rural areas are ‘all population, housing, and territory not included with an urban area’ -- that is, open land and towns with fewer than 2,500 residents.[12] Some USDA programs define rural in terms of geographic isolation and others in terms of population density. Population thresholds for rural communities range from 2,500 to 50,000, depending on the program.[13] For example, eligibility for certain USDA rural housing programs allow a maximum rural population of 35,000.[14] Loans and grants for certain water and waste facilities are limited to areas with a maximum population of 10,000.[15] Farms are defined more consistently. For statistical purposes, both the Census Bureau and USDA define ‘farm’ broadly as any place which produces or sells (or normally would produce or sell) &amp;amp;1,000 of agricultural products. For research and reporting, the Economic Research Service of USDA developed a farm typology based on gross farm income.[16]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However defined, rural America faces challenges. Total rural population has declined for the last several years, reflecting a failure of natural population change to balance outmigration. Rural poverty has remained stable, despite a national decline in poverty rates. Rural employment remains weak in many areas, with low job growth and declining participation in the labor force. Highly-educated workers continue to gravitate to urban areas, where higher earnings are possible.[17] Return migration by professionals with young families, however, reflects the importance of family motivations and rural lifestyle, albeit often at financial sacrifice.[18]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2.3. Rural and Agricultural Land in the United States&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of US land is rural, and agriculture is a major land use. The total land area is about 2.3 billion acres (1 hectare is 2.469 acres). The federal government owns and manages about 28 percent of US land (640 million acres), primarily in Alaska and the mountainous West.[19] More than 60 percent of US land (99 percent of cropland) is privately owned.[20] Land and water areas in the United States (excluding Alaska) occupy about 1.95 billion acres. Almost 1.4 billion acres are nonfederal rural land: cropland (361 million, including 316 million acres of prime farmland), rangeland (409 million), pasture (120 million), and forest (409 million). Urban uses are only a small percentage of total US land.[21]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2012 Census of Agriculture, published in 2014, indicated that the United States has 2.1 million farms, which occupy almost 915 million acres of land (including 390 million acres of cropland). The average farm size is 434 acres, slightly larger than the 418 acre average in 2007. The majority of US farms are small, both in size and in value of sales. About 1.6 million farms have sales of less than &amp;amp;50,000, and 1.4 million are smaller than 180 acres. In contrast, about 155,000 farms have sales over &amp;amp;500,000, and about 173,000 are larger than 1000 acres. Most farms are operated by individuals or families, with only about 13 percent operated by partnerships, corporations, or other entities.[22] Full owners operate about 68 percent of farms (average size, 235 acres), but farm tenants operate larger farms. Part owners occupy 25 percent of farms (average size, 922 acres) and full tenants, 7 percent (average size, 588 acres).[23]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Conservation Programs for Rural Areas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the 1930s, the United States has implemented conservation programs for farmers, often with cost-sharing and technical assistance to encourage soil conservation practices. The 1985 Farm Bill, influenced by environmental interest groups, added innovative conservation programs, including retirement of vulnerable land. Subsequent Farm Bills added new programs and emphasized conservation on working lands.[24] Many federal conservation programs are voluntary; they offer incentives for conservation practices, but do not impose requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2014 Farm Bill (Title II) consolidated USDA conservation programs by repealing several easement and cost-share programs available to private landowners, as well as other programs. The Farm Bill repealed programs for Farmland Protection, Grassland Reserve, Wetland Reserve, and Wildlife Habitat Incentives. Their benefits will continue, however, because components of these programs are now included in the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (Wetland Reserve, Farmland Protection, Grasslands Reserve easements), the Conservation Reserve Program (Grasslands Reserve rental contracts), and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (Wildlife Habitat Incentives).[25] Some programs provide support for conservation in watersheds or regions. The new Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), created from four programs repealed in the 2014 Farm Bill, authorizes and supports multi-state or watershed projects and conservation of critical conservation areas.[26]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after consolidation in the 2014 Farm Bill, the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and Farm Service Agency administer 18 conservation program (including 13 Farm Bill programs), albeit with reduced funding. This discussion reviews US conservation programs available to owners of private land. Some of these programs have elements similar to agri-environmental and related measures in the EU.[27]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3.1. Conservation Compliance&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservation compliance, introduced in 1985, required producers who received most types of federal farm support, but not federal crop insurance, to conserve highly erodible land and to protect wetlands.[28] Under the 2014 Farm Bill, conservation compliance now applies to producers who participate in the new federal crop insurance programs, as well as to producers who participate in other government support programs, including loans and conservation programs.[29] Conservation compliance is voluntary, in theory, because only farmers who accept federal farm payments must comply. In 2011, 35 percent of farms received federal farm support, with larger farms more likely to receive payments.[30]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservation compliance for highly erodible land applies if a producer ‘in any crop year produces an agricultural commodity on a field on which highly erodible land is predominant.’[31] To keep highly erodible land in production, to protect soil productivity, and to reduce off-site damage (e.g., water pollution) from soil erosion, producers must apply a conservation plan, using approved conservation systems. Many approved systems, which must be feasible and cost-effective, are inexpensive. Violations normally result in loss of federal farm program payments for all commodities and on all land farmed by the producer.[32]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After decades of government policy that supported conversion of wetlands for cultivation, federal law now protects wetlands. The ‘swampbuster’ provision makes producers ineligible for farm program payments if they produce commodities on converted wetlands after 1985 or converted wetlands for crop production after 1990.[33] A ‘sodsaver’ program enacted in 2008 limits benefits under federal crop insurance programs for farmers in 6 ‘prairie pothole’ states who produce crops on more than 5 acres of newly-tilled native sod. Amendments in the 2014 Farm Bill made the program effective upon enactment, without approval of each state’s governor.[34]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3.2. Conservation Incentives&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservation incentives in the United States include measures for land retirement and support for conservation activities on working land. Land retirement payments have made up about 65 percent of conservation payments, with working land programs making up 35 percent. Since 2003 and continuing in the 2014 Farm Bill, programs for working land enjoy increased funding. In 2011, midsize farms received 33 percent of working land payments; small farms and very large farms received smaller shares. In contrast, 77 percent of land retirement payments went to small farms, including retirement farms and farms with significant off-farm employment.[35]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;3.2.1. Land Retirement&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which celebrated its 30th anniversary in December 2015, offers 10- to 15-year contracts to owners, operators, or tenants who retire eligible land from agricultural use, implement an approved conservation plan, and plant a vegetative cover crop on CRP land. Participants receive annual rental payments, as well as technical assistance and cost-share payments, to establish conservation practices. The 2014 Farm Bill reauthorized and amended the CRP, included environmentally sensitive grasslands, and permitted more activities on CRP land.[36] During general sign-up periods, producers bid to enroll land, and the Farm Service Agency selects land for enrollment that provides maximum environmental benefits under an Environmental Benefits Index. Land that offers high-priority environmental benefits (e.g., riparian buffers, filter strips) can be enrolled under continuous signup. Continuous signup also applies to a farmable wetlands program and the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program which, with cooperation of state and local entities, identifies and retires environmentally sensitive land with high priority for the state or nation. Since 1985, the CRP has prevented over 9 billion tons of soil erosion, significantly reduced run-off of nitrogen (by 95 percent) and phosphorus (by 85 percent), and sequestered about 49 million tons of greenhouse gases annually.[37]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the environmental benefits of the CRP, the 2014 Farm Bill reduced its maximum acreage. By fiscal year 2018, no more than 24 million acres (reduced from a maximum of 32 million in 2013) can be enrolled. In recent years, however, CRP acreage declined from its 2007 high of 36.8 million acres.[38] At the end of November 2015, the CRP held 23.27 million acres under about 632,500 contracts on almost 357,000 farms. Average rental payments were &amp;amp;70 per acre, with lower payments (&amp;amp;51 per acre) for the 17 million acres enrolled in general sign-ups, and higher payments for especially vulnerable land in other programs.[39]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP)[40] replaces several repealed programs: Wetlands Reserve, Farmland Protection, and Grassland Reserve. ACEP now governs voluntary agricultural land and wetland reserve easements, which impose permanent or long term land-use restrictions. The USDA provides funding to help ‘eligible entities’ (state or local government agencies or conservation organizations) purchase agricultural land easements on environmentally significant land and may provide technical assistance for conservation activities under an agricultural land easement plan. Generally the federal share will not exceed 50 percent of the appraised value of the easement. Land selected for easements should protect agricultural uses and conservation values.[41] Wetland reserve easements are intended to ‘restore, protect, and enhance wetlands’ through permanent or 30-year easements.[42] Landowners submit offers for participation to USDA for evaluation under criteria that maximize the benefits of federal investment. Wetland easements that will enhance habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife receive priority for enrollment. Landowners must agree to grant an easement on their land and to implement a wetland reserve easement plan developed by USDA. In exchange, landowners receive payment for the easement, along with financial and technical assistance for conservation measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;3.2.2. Working Lands&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)[43] promotes agricultural production and environmental quality as compatible goals. Under the 2014 Farm Bill, EQIP now incorporates the goals of the repealed Wildlife Habitats Incentive Program. By providing assistance for installing and maintaining conservation practices compatible with continued food and fiber production, EQIP helps producers to comply with regulatory requirements that protect soil, water and air quality, preserve wildlife habitat, and conserve surface and groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EQIP authorizes the USDA to enter contracts with producers who implement eligible environmental and conservation practices, including site-specific structural practices, land management practices, comprehensive nutrient management planning, irrigation and water conservation, wildlife habitat protection, and conservation practices related to organic production. Participants must submit and implement an EQIP conservation plan. They receive cost-share payments to plan and implement conservation practices and payments for income foregone. Contracts may not exceed 10 years, and EQIP payments are generally limited to &amp;amp;450,000 between fiscal years 2014 through 2018.[44] Environmental practices related to livestock production must receive at least 60 percent of EQIP funds, and practices that benefit wildlife habitat must receive at least 5 percent of EQIP funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While EQIP provides funding to implement practices, the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP)[45] is a voluntary ‘payment for performance’ program that provides on-going support for environmental performance on many types of land. The 2014 Farm Bill reauthorized the CSP, rewrote its statutory language, and demanded additional conservation benefits from participants.[46] The amended CSP encourages producers to address ‘priority resource concerns’ by ‘improving, maintaining, and managing existing conservation activities’ and ‘undertaking additional conservation activities.’[47] To participate, producers must meet a stewardship threshold (an effective level of management) for at least two priority resource concerns; by the end of the 5-year contract, the producer must meet or exceed the stewardship threshold for at least one additional concern. USDA ranks applications, and participants who enroll must operate under a conservation stewardship plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enrollment in CSP is limited to 10 million acres per year (reduced from 12.8 million under prior law) in 2014 through 2022; average total cost per CSP acre should be &amp;amp;18. CSP payments are limited to &amp;amp;200,000 between fiscal years 2014 through 2018.[48]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payments under USDA Farm programs help to encourage adoption of some conservation practices. USDA research has found that adoption of conservation practices, including no-till, cover crop, and nutrient management practices that help to combat climate change, varies with the crop and the region of the country.[49] USDA research also concluded that, even without government payments, farmers are more likely to adopt practices that increase profits. Government payments encourage producers to adopt expensive practices (e.g., structural practices like terraces, buffers) and those with ‘limited onfarm benefits’ or to adopt those practices sooner.[50]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;3.2.3. Forestry&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many rural areas, forests are a significant land use, especially for timber, and most are privately-owned.[51] One goal of the current USDA Strategic Plan is management of resources in forests, grasslands, and working lands with objectives to improve management, reduce the risk of wildfires, mitigate and adapt to climate change, and protect water resources.[52] The USDA has also published a Strategic Framework to promote agroforestry -- ‘the intentional combining of agriculture and forestry to create integrated and sustainable land-use systems’ in which producers plant trees and shrubs with crops and/or livestock.[53] Five USDA agencies, state foresters, and conservation districts will cooperate to increase agroforestry, integrate agroforestry with conservation and economic development, and advance the science of agroforestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2014 Farm Bill (Title VIII) repealed several programs that provided support for forestry. It reauthorized much of the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act,[54] which provides federal assistance for state efforts to manage and protect non-federal forests. A Forest Stewardship Program works with state forestry agencies to help private owners of nonindustrial forests adopt sustainable management practices.[55] Although this program does not provide financial support for owners, private forest land is eligible for support under some federal conservation programs (e.g., the CSP discussed above).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003[56] authorizes actions, including clearing brush and controlling insects, to prevent forest fires. It includes a voluntary Healthy Forest Reserves Program,[57] which authorizes easements and financial support for forests on privately-owned land in 16 states. The 2014 Farm Bill continued this program, which is connected with the new Regional Conservation Partnership Program.[58] Through easements, 30-year contracts, and 10-year cost-share agreements, the Program helps landowners to promote the primary goal, recovery of endangered or threatened species; secondary goals are to improve biodiversity and to enhance carbon sequestration. Land enrolled in the program is subject to a restoration plan, and landowners receive payments and technical assistance.[59]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Support for Specialized Producers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4.1. Organic Agriculture&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDA statistics indicate that almost 20,000 US farms and processing facilities had earned organic certification by the end of 2014 -- a 250 percent increase since 2002.[60] USDA’s 2014 Organic Survey identified 14,093 organic farms, either certified (12,634) or exempt from certification, on almost 3.7 million acres.[61] Almost 12,200 of these farms (10,900 of certified farms) earned 50 percent or more of total market value from organic products.[62] Although organic products often command a price premium, more than 4 percent of US food sales in 2014 were organic products, with fruits and vegetables accounting for 43 percent of organic sales.[63] Relatively few farmers produce organic field crops; in 2014, only 6,168 certified organic farms and 254 exempt organic farms produced field crops on about 1.4 million acres.[64] Organic corn, soybeans, and wheat used ‘less than 1 percent of the total acreage of each crop.’[65]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Organic Food Production Act and related regulations govern organic certification under the National Organic Program.[66] Legislation authorizes support for producers who will transition to organic production and seek certification.[67] The USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service operates the National Organic Certification Cost-Share Program, which pays up to 75 percent of certification costs for producers who seek organic certification.[68]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voluntary conservation programs also support organic practices. EQIP, discussed above, offers financial support and technical assistance to producers who implement conservation practices, specified in an organic plan approved under the National Organic Program, related to organic production or transition to organic production.[69] Organic producers may participate in the Conservation Stewardship Program, and they may initiate organic certification while farming under a CSP contract.[70]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other provisions encourage organic agriculture. For example, the 2014 Farm Bill increased availability of federal crop insurance for organic crops.[71] The Farm Bill also authorized grants to support research, education, and outreach on a number of subjects that will facilitate organic agricultural production.[72]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4.2. Local and Regional Foods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local and regional food systems are ‘place-specific clusters of agricultural producers of all kinds -- farmers, ranchers, fishers -- along with consumers and institutions engaged in producing, processing, distributing, and selling foods.’[73] Many types of farm operations participate in local food systems, which include, for example, direct sales, community-supported agriculture, farmers’ markets, farm-to school, on-farm sales, and others.[74] In 2012, almost 8 percent of US farms marketed foods locally, with a sales total of about &amp;amp;6.1 billion; about half of local food sales were produce (vegetables, fruits, nuts). Most farms (85 percent) selling in local markets were small, with less than &amp;amp;75,000 gross cash farm income, but mid-size farms (gross cash farm income over &amp;amp;350,000) had 67 percent of local sales.[75] Little overlap exists between producers of organic and local foods. Few local foods farms (about 5 percent) are certified (or certification-exempt) organic. About 46 percent of certified organic farms sold directly to consumers or in marketing channels.[76]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Producers of food sold locally, like other producers, are eligible to participate in various USDA programs. In addition, the federal government supports local food through its Farmers’ Market and Local Food Promotion Program,[77] which provides grants to eligible entities (agri-business networks, local governments, nonprofits, etc.) to increase consumption of locally- and regionally-produced foods, develop market opportunities, and assist in development of direct markets (e.g., farmers’ markets, community-supported agriculture) and business enterprises. Specialty Crop Block Grants[78] fund projects, administered by states, to support local foods, especially fruits and vegetables. Value-Added Producer Grants (see below) can be used to develop value-added products sold in local markets. Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food, a USDA program, strengthens local and regional food production. It helps individuals and communities to identify USDA programs and sources of funding and expertise to support local food projects.[79] The Farm-to-School program, provides cost-share grants for pilot projects that improve access to local foods for schools.[80]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State and local food programs also help to provide access to local foods. States, for example, support farm-to-school programs, facilitate farmers’ markets, and encourage urban agriculture. Local governments and nongovernmental organizations also promote local food.[81]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4.3. Value-Added Agricultural Products&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;USDA Value-Added Producer Grants provide planning and working capital for agricultural producers and specified producer groups to develop enterprises that produce value-added products. For purposes of the grant program, a ‘value-added agricultural product’ is any agricultural commodity or product that has undergone a ‘change in physical state’ (e.g., diced tomatoes or wool rugs), is produced or segregated in a way that enhances its value (e.g., organic crops), is a source of renewable energy (including E-85 fuel), or is marketed as locally-produced food. In addition, the physical change or manner of production must expand the customer base, and the producer must receive increased revenue from marketing, processing, or physical segregation of the product.[82]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2014 Farm Bill amended this program, first enacted in 2000 and expanded in 2002 and 2008.[83] Under the amended provisions, grants are available both to certain organizations (e.g., producer groups, cooperatives) and to independent producers. Priority for grants goes to operators of small and medium sized family farms, beginning farmers or ranchers, social disadvantaged farmers (those subject to racial, ethnic, or gender prejudice, as defined by statute), and farmers or ranchers who are veterans of the US Armed Forces. A beginning farmer has operated a farm for no more than 10 years. A veteran farmer or rancher has not operated a farm or ranch or has operated for fewer than 10 years.[84] Maximum grants are &amp;amp;75,000 for planning and &amp;amp;250,000 for working capital.[85] Recipients must match grant funds with non-federal funds or in-kind contributions. The 2014 Farm Bill significantly increased mandatory annual funding for these grants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Statutory Preferences for Producers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some USDA programs identify farmers and ranchers who receive priority consideration, enhanced financial support, or other benefits. Depending on the program, these farmers include limited resource producers, beginning farmers and ranchers, socially disadvantaged producers (including women), and (since 2014) military veterans. The following discussion focuses mainly on beginning and women farmers, who are also eligible for support under EU Regulation 1305/2013.[86]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5.1. Beginning Farmers&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;US farmers are growing older. In 2012, the average age of principal operators was 58.3 years.[87] Operators younger than 35 make up a small proportion of US farmers. Many US producers combine farming with other employment. In 2012, among operators who spend more than 50 percent of their time farming (almost 48 percent of total farmers), only 2.6 percent were younger than 35. Among operators who spend less than 50 percent of time farming (52 percent), 3 percent were younger than 35.[88] Not all beginning farmers are young,[89] however, and for government programs the status of beginning farmer depends on time in farming. For some programs, a beginning farmer is an individual with no more than 10 years of experience as an operator; for others, the limit is 5 years of experience.[90]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning farmers benefit from dedicated programs and also from special provisions in more general USDA programs. Many of these benefits also apply to socially disadvantaged farmers and veterans of military service.[91] For example, beginning farmers receive special educational opportunities. The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program, first adopted in 2002, offers grants to organizations ‘to provide training, education, outreach, and technical assistance initiatives’ for a new generation of farmers.[92] Educational goals are broad and focus on most subjects helpful to beginning farmers. Public or private entities, including colleges and universities, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations, are eligible for grants. Projects led by academic institutions have received a significant share (in 2014, the majority) of grant money under the program. These educational grants are ‘a key way for the nation to invest intelligently and cost-effectively’ in the success of ‘the next generation of family farmers.’[93] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning farmers sometimes receive enrollment priority or higher payments under USDA programs. For example, 10 percent of funding for Value-Added Producer Grants is reserved for beginning and socially-disadvantaged farmers.[94] Under the Farm Bill’s supplemental coverage crop insurance program, which provides financial support to pay certain insurance premiums, a beginning farmer may receive 10 percent more premium assistance than other farmers.[95] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some conservation programs (EQIP and CSP) set aside a portion of available acres or funds or offer higher cost-share payments for beginning farmers.[96] Under EQIP, for example, beginning, socially disadvantaged, veteran, and limited resource farmers can receive cost-share payments of 90 percent (instead of 75 percent) and at least 25 percent more than the applicable rate for other payments.[97] Under the CSP, at least 5 percent of eligible acres in each fiscal year must assist beginning farmers, and 5 percent, socially disadvantaged farmers. USDA must make a special outreach effort to inform these farmers about the CSP.[98] To encourage transfer of land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve to beginning farmers, the USDA may authorize contract modifications that facilitate transitions of land from retiring owners to beginning or socially disadvantaged farmers who will farm the land using sustainable methods. A transition incentives program authorizes two extra years of CRP payments to retiring landowners or operators with expiring CRP contracts if they sell or lease their land to beginning farmers who will plant a crop using a conservation plan.[99] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Farm Service Agency of USDA is the ‘lender of first opportunity for borrowers who are not yet creditworthy for regular commercial business loans.’[100] Loan funds from the FSA are reserved for beginning farmers, defined as those who have not operated a farm for more than 10 (or, for some loans, fewer) years and (for ownership loans) who do not own a farm larger than 30 percent of the average farm size in their county.[101] Beginning farmers have priority for 75 percent of funding for farm ownership loans and 50 percent of operating loans for the first 11 months of each fiscal year; they have priority for 40 percent of guaranteed farm ownership and operating loans for the first 6 months.[102] Some state programs, too, encourage beginning farmers by authorizing loan guarantees, subsidizing reduced interest rates, and encourage landowners to lease farmland.[103]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5.2. Women Farmers&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, women principal operators are a minority, only 14 percent of total principal operators. In 2012, about 288,000 women were principal operators on farms (most fully owned) with land totaling about 63 million acres. Most farms operated by women are small; the majority are smaller than 50 acres, and only about 6 percent are larger than 500 acres. Only 9 percent have sales over &amp;amp;50,000. Sales from farms operated by women were 3.3 percent of the US total, on 6.9 percent of farmland.[104]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women receive priority for some federal programs as socially disadvantaged farmers. That is, they are members of a socially disadvantaged group, ‘whose members have been subjected to ... gender prejudice … without regard to their individual qualities.’[105] Thus, women are eligible for a number of the programs discussed above with reference to beginning farmers. The Farm Service Agency of USDA targets loan funds to women and other socially disadvantaged applicants. These include guaranteed loans, direct farm operating loans (for equipment and other operating expenses), and direct farm ownership loans (loans up to &amp;amp;300,000 for farmers with at least 3 years of experience in day-to-day farm management).[106]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States, with abundant rural land and natural resources, is an agrarian nation. Rural areas are valued for production of food, fiber, and timber; as living space for rural residents; and for their natural beauty, habitat, recreational opportunities, and other amenities. The majority of US rural land is privately owned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Department of Agriculture implements federal laws and regulations that support rural development, improve the quality of life, and protect environmental resources. Under the 2014 Farm Bill and other statutes, conservation programs impose conservation compliance requirements, support retirement of vulnerable land, and promote conservation activities on working land. Other statutory provisions support organic agriculture, promote local and regional food sales, and help producers to add value to their products. Beginning farmers, veterans, and socially disadvantaged farmers, including women, receive priority for some USDA programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US rural development measures, along with other programs, provide opportunities to ensure continued agricultural production, promote environmental sustainability, stimulate economic development, and improve living conditions in rural areas in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;</content><legacyfootnotes/><footnotes><footnote>1 Professor Emerita and Bock Chair Emerita in Agricultural Law, University of Illinois, USA; Fellow, Wageningen School of Social Sciences, Law and Governance Group, Wageningen, Netherlands.
